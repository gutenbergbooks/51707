<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>The plan of the Third Reader is the same as that of the Second, with
the exception that a few historical lessons have been introduced, and two
lessons which may serve as an introduction to Physical Science. The
botanical lessons supplement those given in the Second Reader. These, and
the lessons on Canadian trees, and all lessons relating to things in nature,
should be made the subjects of conversation between the teacher and his
class, and should form a basis for scientific instruction. The pupils should be
led to study nature directly. To this end they should be required to obtain
(wherever possible) the natural objects which are described in the lessons,
and to examine them, and to form opinions for themselves concerning them.</p>

<p>Similarly, every lesson should form the subject of conversation&mdash;before
reading, during the progress of the reading, and after reading:&mdash;the teacher
eliciting from his pupils clear statements of their knowledge of it, correcting
any wrong notions they may have of it, throwing them back upon
their own experience or reading, and leading them to observe, compare,
and judge, and to state in words the results of their observations,
comparisons, and judgments. Some of these statements should be written
on the blackboard, and then be made the subject of critical conversation;
others might be written by the pupils at their desks, and afterwards be
reviewed in class. In this incidental teaching, it should be the teacher’s aim
to develop the previous imperfect knowledge of the pupils concerning a
lesson into a full and complete knowledge. This can best be effected by
judicious questioning and conversation.</p>

<p>The illustrations of the lessons, as in the Second Reader, are intended to
aid the pupils in obtaining real conceptions of the ideas involved in the
lessons. Children vary greatly in capacity for imagination. It is essential,
however, to the proper understanding of a lesson, and hence to the proper
reading of it, that a child be able to imagine the persons, actions, objects,
described in it. The illustrations will aid in developing this power of
imagination, and the teacher by his questions and appropriate criticisms,
and by a judicious use of his own greater knowledge and experience, will
aid still more in developing it.</p>

<p>In the poetry great care has been taken to select not only such pieces as
children can easily comprehend, but also such as are in themselves good
literature. Many old favorites have been retained, their worth as reading
lessons having been proved with generations of school children. In the
reading of poetry the teacher must constantly assure himself that the
pupils clearly understand what they read. Children have a natural ear for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
rhythm, and a fondness for rhyme. Hence they easily learn to read verse
being insensibly charmed by its melody. But they cannot, with equal
facility, comprehend the poetical meanings, the terse expressions, and the
inverted constructions, with which verse abounds. Much more time, therefore,
should be spent by the teacher, in poetry than in prose, in eliciting from
his pupils the meanings of words, phrases, and sentences. He should not
rest satisfied until the pupils can substitute for every more important word,
phrase, and sentence of a poem, an equivalent of their own finding. He
must be certain too that they understand the substitutions which they offer.
Conversation and questioning will here, as elsewhere in school work, help
him in effecting his purpose.</p>

<p>The exercises which are put at the end of some of the lessons are intended
merely as examples of exercises which the teacher can himself prepare for all
the lessons. Methods of using these have been described in the Preface to
the Second Reader. In the Word Exercises, many of the words have been
re-spelled phonetically to indicate their pronunciation. This too is merely
an example of what may be done with all words. Pupils should be taught
to pick out the silent letters in words, and to indicate the true phonetic
equivalents of the “orthographical expedients,” as they are called, by which
vowel sounds are often indicated. For example, in <i>neighbour</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>h</i>, and
either <i>o</i> or <i>u</i> are silent, and <i>ei</i> does duty for <i>ā</i>; so that the pronunciation of
the word may be indicated by <i>nā’bor</i> or <i>nā’bur</i>. It will be a useful exercise
for the pupils sometimes to write out in this way, on the blackboard,
the phonetic spelling of the irregularly spelled words which occur in
their lessons, alongside of their common spelling. Practice will soon give
facility in doing this. It is believed that by such practice the orthography
of irregularly spelled words will be more easily remembered, and accuracy
of pronunciation more readily gained.</p>

<p>To aid in securing accuracy of pronunciation, a short chapter on Orthoëpy
has been prefixed to the reading lessons. The statements in it are to form
a basis for lessons to be given by the teacher to the pupils in conversation.
Orthoëpy is acquired only by constant attention to utterance. Carefulness
in enunciation must first become a habit. The correct pronunciation
of individual words will then be gained by the imitation of those who
speak correctly, or reference to a dictionary. It is true that in the
pronunciation of many words, authorities differ widely; hence dogmatism in
pronunciation is to be avoided. Notwithstanding this, no one can hope
to become a correct speaker without the careful study of a dictionary. The
teacher should see that the system of sound-marking adopted by the
dictionary in use in his school, is understood by his pupils, so that they
may consult it intelligently.</p>

<h2>ORTHOËPY.</h2>

<p>1. <b>Orthoëpy</b> or <b>Correct Pronunciation</b>, is the utterance of
words with their right sounds and accents, as sanctioned by the best usage.
It depends principally upon <b>Articulation</b>, <b>Syllabication</b>, and
<b>Accentuation</b>.</p>

<p>2. <b>Articulation</b> is the distinct utterance of the elementary vowel and
consonant sounds of the language, whether separate, or combined into
syllables and words. In pronouncing a word its elementary sounds should
be correctly articulated.</p>

<p>3. The more <b>common faults in articulation</b> are:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(1) <i>Omitting a vowel sound, or substituting one vowel sound for another, in
an unaccented syllable.</i> Of all faults in pronunciation probably this is the
commonest. As a rule it results from carelessness in utterance. Examples
of it are:&mdash;pronouncing&mdash;arithmetic, <i>’rithmetic</i>; library, <i>līb’ry</i>; literature,
<i>lit’rature</i>; geography, <i>j’ography</i>; barrel, <i>barr’l</i>; below, <i>b’low</i>; family,
<i>fam’ly</i>; violent, <i>vi’lent</i>; history, <i>hist’ry</i>; memory, <i>mem’ry</i>; regular, <i>reg’lar</i>;
usual, <i>ūzh’al</i>; alwāys, <i>alwŭz</i>; afford, <i>ŭfford</i>; abundant, <i>abundŭnt</i>; eatable,
<i>eatŭble</i>; America, <i>Ameriky</i>; childrĕn, <i>childrin</i>; modĕst, <i>modŭst</i>; commandment,
<i>commandmŭnt</i>; judgment, <i>judgmŭnt</i>; moment, <i>momŭnt</i>; kindness,
<i>kindniss</i>; gospĕl, <i>gospil</i>; pockĕt, <i>pockit</i>; ēmotion, <i>immotion</i>; charĭty,
<i>charŭty</i>; opposĭte, <i>oppozŭt</i>; potatō, <i>pŭtatĕh</i>; patriŏt, <i>patriŭt</i>; ōbedience,
<i>ŭbediĕnce</i>; accūrāte, <i>ak’er-ĭt</i>; particūlar, <i>partikĭlĕr</i>.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Substituting one vowel sound for another in an accented syllable or a
one-syllabled word.</i> This fault may result, not from carelessness, but from
want of knowledge, for the correct pronunciation of the vowel sounds of
words must be learned from some correct speaker, or from a dictionary.

<p>4. <b>Syllabication</b> (in Orthoëpy) is the correct formation of syllables in
pronouncing words. A syllable is a sound, or a combination of sounds,
uttered by a single impulse of the voice, and constituting a word or a part of
a word. A word has as many syllables as it has separate vowel sounds.
When words are uttered so that their vowel sounds are clearly and correctly
articulated, they will be properly syllabified.</p>

<p>5. <b>Accentuation</b> is the correct placing of accent in uttering words.
<b>Accent</b> is a superior stress or force of voice upon certain syllables of
words which distinguishes them from the other syllables. In uttering a
word of more than one syllable, one of the syllables receives a greater stress
in pronunciation than the others, and is said to be <i>accented</i>, or to <i>have the
accent</i>. Some words have more than one syllable accented, as <i>con´fla-gra´´tion</i>,
<i>in-com´pre-hen´si-bil´´ity</i>; but one syllable is always more strongly accented
than the others, and is said to have the <i>main</i> or <i>primary accent</i>. Accentuation,
like the other elements of orthoëpy, is fixed by usage; that is, by
the practice of those who are recognized as correct speakers.</p>

<p>6. In the pronunciation of a word care should be taken to give to the
vowels their proper sounds, to place the accent upon the right syllable, and
to sound the consonants distinctly. The tendency to drop consonant sounds,
and to pronounce indistinctly or incorrectly the vowel sounds of unaccented
syllables, should be carefully guarded against. The distinction between
syllables should be carefully made, and especially, the distinction between
separate words. Carelessness in this respect may make the meanings of
sentences uncertain. For example:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>He saw two beggars steal</i>, may sound as, <i>He sought to beg or steal</i>;</p>

<p><i>He had two small eggs</i>, may sound as, <i>He had two small legs</i>; and</p>

<p><i>Can there be an aim more lofty?</i> as, <i>Can there be a name more lofty?</i></p>

</div>

<p>This blending of the sounds of words is prevented, partly by distinctly
uttering the sounds of their initial letters, but chiefly by distinctly uttering
and slightly dwelling upon the sounds of their final letters.</p>

<h2><a name="I_THE_WHITE_SHIP" id="I_THE_WHITE_SHIP"></a>I.&mdash;THE WHITE SHIP.</h2>

<p class="author">Charles Dickens.</p>

<p>King Henry I. went over to Normandy with his son
Prince William and a great retinue, to have the prince
acknowledged as his successor, and to contract a marriage
between him and the daughter of the Count of Anjou.
Both these things were triumphantly done, with great
show and rejoicing; and on the 25th of November, in
the year 1120, the whole retinue prepared to embark, for
the voyage home.</p>

<p>On that day, there came to the king, Fitz-Stephen, a
sea-captain, and said, “My liege, my father served your
father all his life, upon the sea. He steered the ship
with the golden boy upon the prow, in which your father
sailed to conquer England. I have a fair vessel in the
harbor here, called The White Ship, manned by fifty
sailors of renown. I pray you, Sire, to let your servant
have the honor of steering you in The White Ship to
England.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry, friend,” replied the king, “that my ship
is already chosen, and that I cannot, therefore, sail with
the son of the man who served my father. But the prince
and his company shall go along with you in the fair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
White Ship, manned by the fifty sailors of renown.”
An hour or two afterward, the king set sail in the vessel
he had chosen, accompanied by other vessels, and, sailing
all night with a fair and gentle wind, arrived upon the
coast of England in the morning. While it was yet night,
the people in some of these ships heard a faint, wild cry
come over the sea, and wondered what it was.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/p012.jpg" width="300" height="320" alt="A ship in a storm" />
</div>

<p>Now, the prince was a dissolute young man of eighteen,
who bore no love to the English, and who had declared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
that when he came to the throne he would yoke them to
the plough like oxen. He went aboard The White Ship
with one hundred and forty youthful nobles like himself,
among whom were eighteen noble ladies of the highest
rank. All this gay company, with their servants and the
fifty sailors, made three hundred souls aboard the fair
White Ship.</p>

<p>“Give three casks of wine, Fitz-Stephen,” said the
prince, “to the fifty sailors of renown. My father the
king has sailed out of the harbor. What time is there to
make merry here, and yet reach England with the rest?”</p>

<p>“Prince,” said Fitz-Stephen, “before morning my fifty
and The White Ship shall overtake the swiftest vessel
in attendance on your father the king if we sail at midnight.”
Then the prince commanded to make merry; and
the sailors drank out the three casks of wine, and the
prince and all the noble company danced in the moonlight
on the deck of The White Ship.</p>

<p>When, at last, she shot out of the harbor, there was not
a sober seaman on board. But the sails were all set and
the oars all going merrily. Fitz-Stephen had the helm.
The gay young nobles and the beautiful ladies, wrapped
in mantles of various bright colors to protect them from
the cold, talked, laughed, and sang. The prince encouraged
the fifty sailors to row yet harder, for the honor of
The White Ship.</p>

<p>Crash! A terrific cry broke from three hundred hearts.
It was the cry the people in the distant vessels of the
king heard faintly on the water. The White Ship had
struck upon a rock,&mdash;was filling,&mdash;going down! Fitz-Stephen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
hurried the prince into a boat with some few
nobles. “Push off,” he whispered, “and row to the land.
It is not far, and the sea is smooth. The rest of us must
die.” But as they rowed fast away from the sinking
ship, the prince heard the voice of his sister calling for
help. He never in his life had been so good as he was
then. He cried in agony, “Row back at any risk! I
cannot bear to leave her!”</p>

<p>They rowed back. As the prince held out his arm to
catch his sister, such numbers leaped into the boat that
it was overset. And in the same instant The White
Ship went down. Only two men floated. They both
clung to the mainyard of the ship, which had broken
from the mast and now supported them. One asked the
other who he was. He replied, “I am a nobleman,&mdash;Godfrey
by name, son of Gilbert. And you?”&mdash;“I am a
poor butcher of Rouen,” was the answer. Then they said
together, “Lord be merciful to us both!” and tried to
encourage each other as they drifted in the cold, benumbing
sea on that unfortunate November night.</p>

<p>By and by another man came swimming toward them,
whom they knew, when he pushed aside his long wet
hair, to be Fitz-Stephen. “Where is the prince?” said
he. “Gone, gone!” the two cried together. “Neither he,
nor his brother, nor his sister, nor the king’s niece, nor
her brother, nor any one of all the brave three hundred,
noble or commoner, except us three, has risen above the
water!” Fitz-Stephen, with a ghastly face, cried, “Woe!
woe to me!” and sank to the bottom.</p>

<p>The other two clung to the yard for some hours. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
length the young noble said faintly, “I am exhausted, and
chilled with the cold, and can hold no longer. Farewell,
good friend! God preserve you!” So he dropped and
sank; and, of all the brilliant crowd, the poor butcher of
Rouen alone was saved. In the morning some fishermen
saw him floating in his sheep-skin coat, and got him into
their boat,&mdash;the sole relator of the dismal tale.</p>

<p>For three days no one dared to carry the intelligence
to the king. At length they sent into his presence a little
boy, who, weeping bitterly and falling at his feet, told
him that The White Ship was lost with all on board.
The king fell to the ground like a dead man, and never,
never afterward was seen to smile.</p>

<h2><a name="III_THE_GIRAFFE_OR_CAMELOPARD" id="III_THE_GIRAFFE_OR_CAMELOPARD"></a>III.&mdash;THE GIRAFFE OR CAMELOPARD.</h2>

<p>There are few sights more pleasing than a herd of tall,
graceful giraffes. With their heads reaching a height of
from twelve to eighteen feet, they move about in small
herds on the open plains
of Africa, eating the
tender twigs and leaves
of the mimosa and
other trees.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 239px;">
<img src="images/p018.jpg" width="239" height="500" alt="Three giraffes by a stand of trees" />
</div>

<p>The legs of a large
giraffe are about nine
feet long and its neck
nearly six feet; while
its body measures only
seven feet in length and
slopes rapidly from the
neck to the tail. The
graceful appearance of
the giraffe is increased
by the beauty of its
skin, which is orange
red in color, and mottled
with dark spots. Its
long tail has at the end
a tuft of thick hair,
which serves the purpose
of keeping off the
flies and stinging insects, so plentiful in the hot climate
of Africa.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>Its tongue is very wonderful. It is from thirteen to
seventeen inches in length, is slender and pointed, and is
capable of being moved in so many ways, that it is almost
as useful to the giraffe as the trunk is to the elephant.</p>

<p>The horns of the giraffe are very short and covered
with skin. At the ends there are tufts of short hair.
The animal has divided hoofs somewhat resembling those
of the ox.</p>

<p>The head of the giraffe is small, and its eyes large and
mild looking. These eyes are set in such a way that the
animal can see a great deal of what is behind it, without
turning its head. In addition to its wonderful power of
sight, the giraffe can scent danger from a great distance;
so that there is no animal more difficult of approach.</p>

<p>Strange to relate, the giraffe has no voice. In London,
some years ago, two giraffes were burned to death in their
stables, when the slightest sound would have given notice
of their danger, and have saved their lives.</p>

<p>The giraffe is naturally both gentle and timid, and he
will always try to avoid danger by flight. It is when
running that he exposes his only ungraceful point. He
runs swiftly, but since he moves his fore and hind legs on
each side at the same time, the movement gives him a
very awkward gait. But though timid, he will, when
overtaken, turn even upon the lion or panther, and defend
himself successfully by powerful kicks with his strong legs.</p>

<p>The natives of Africa capture the giraffe in pitfalls,
which are deep holes covered over with branches of trees
and dirt. When captured, the giraffe can be tamed, and
during its captivity it gives scarcely any trouble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Fifty years ago, but little was known about the giraffe in
America or Europe. Now it is to be found in menageries
and the public gardens of large cities. The giraffe thrives
in captivity and seems to be well satisfied with a diet of
corn and hay. It is a source of great satisfaction to
those who admire this beautiful animal, that there is
nothing to prevent it from living in a climate so
different from that of its African home.</p>

<h2><a name="VI_THE_CAMEL" id="VI_THE_CAMEL"></a>VI.&mdash;THE CAMEL.</h2>

<p>In Asia and in Africa there are vast plains of sand, upon
which no grass grows, and through which no river runs.
These plains are as smooth as the ocean unmoved by
waves. As far as the eye can reach, nothing is to be
seen but sand. In the middle of the day when the sun
is hottest, the sand dazzles the eyes of the traveller, as if
there were a sun beneath the sand as well as one above.</p>

<p>Here and there, but many miles apart, are green spots
consisting of bushes, trees, and grass, growing around a
small pool or spring of water. These green spots are
called oases. Here the tired traveller can find food and
shade, and can sleep awhile, sheltered from the blazing sun.</p>

<p>How do you think the traveller crosses these burning
plains? Not in carriages, nor on horseback, nor in railroad
trains, but on the backs of tall, long-necked, humpbacked
camels.</p>

<p>Even if you have seen camels alive, or pictures of
them, you will still be glad to learn more about these
very useful animals.</p>

<p>The camel lives on grass, and the dry short herbage,
which is found on the edges of the desert. While travelling
in the desert, it is fed upon dates and barley. It is able
to eat a great deal of food at a time and to drink enough
water to last some days. By this means, it can go for a
long time without food, and travel long distances without
stopping to eat or drink. The camel has a curious lump
of fat on the top of its back called a “hump.” One kind
of camel has two humps. One purpose of these humps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
is to supply the camel with strength, when it has neither
food nor water, and would
otherwise die from want.</p>

<p>The foot of the camel is
a wonderful thing. It is
broad, and has a soft pad at
the bottom, which keeps it
from sinking in the yielding
sand, when the camel crosses
the arid deserts.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 377px;">
<img src="images/p025.jpg" width="377" height="500" alt="A camel train arriving at a desert oasis, surrounded by palm trees" />
</div>

<p>The camel with two humps on its back is much larger
and stronger than the camel with one hump. The one-humped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
camel is known as the Arabian camel or dromedary.
Asia is the home of the camel, but numbers of
them are used in Africa and other parts of the world.
The camel is trained to kneel down to receive its load,
and to let its master get on its back. The camel can
smell water at a great distance. When its rider is nearly
dead from thirst, and water is near, he can tell it by the
greater speed at which the camel begins to travel.</p>

<p>The camel is often called the “ship of the desert.” As
the desert is like a sea, and the green spots upon it like
islands, so is the camel like a ship, that can carry the
traveller from one point to another, quickly and safely.
But even with his faithful camel, the traveller does not
care to cross the desert alone. The difficulties of keeping
in the right track, and the fear of wild Arabs, make it
much safer for a number of travellers to cross the desert
together.</p>

<p>Travellers take with them camel-drivers and men who
know the way, to look after the beasts when they stop
for the night. These men light the fires, cook the food,
and fill the large skin-bottles with water when they come
to a spring. The travellers, camels, and camel-drivers,
together, form what is called a caravan.</p>

<h2><a name="VIII_THE_EMPEROR_AND_THE_MAJOR" id="VIII_THE_EMPEROR_AND_THE_MAJOR"></a>VIII.&mdash;THE EMPEROR AND THE MAJOR.</h2>

<p>The Emperor Alexander, while travelling in Western
Russia, came one day to a small town of which he knew
very little; so, when he found that he must change horses,
he thought that he would look around and see what the
town was like.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/p030.jpg" width="400" height="365" alt="The Emperor encountering the smoking major on a doorstep" />
</div>

<p>Alone, habited in a plain military coat, without any
mark of his high rank, he wandered through the place
until he came to the end of the road that he had been
following. There he paused, not knowing which way to
turn; for two paths were before him,&mdash;one to the right
and one to the left.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>Alexander saw a man standing at the door of a house;
and, going up to him, the Emperor said, “My friend, can
you tell me which of these two roads I must take to get
to Kalouga?” The man, who was in full military dress,
was smoking a pipe with an air of dignity almost ridiculous.
Astonished that so plain-looking a traveller should
dare to speak to him with familiarity, the smoker answered
shortly, “To the right.”</p>

<p>“Pardon!” said the Emperor. “Another word, if you
please.”&mdash;“What?” was the haughty reply.&mdash;“Permit
me to ask you a question,” continued the Emperor.
“What is your grade in the army?”&mdash;“Guess.” And the
pipe blazed away furiously.&mdash;“Lieutenant?” said the
amused Alexander.&mdash;“Up!” came proudly from the
smoker’s lips.&mdash;“Captain?”&mdash;“Higher.”&mdash;“Major?”&mdash;“At
last!” was the lofty response. The Emperor bowed low
in the presence of such greatness.</p>

<p>“Now, in my turn,” said the major, with the grand air
that he thought fit to assume in addressing a humble
inferior, “what are you, if you please?”&mdash;“Guess,”
answered Alexander.&mdash;“Lieutenant?”&mdash;“Up!”&mdash;“Captain?”&mdash;“Higher.”&mdash;“Major?”&mdash;“Go
on.”&mdash;“Colonel?”&mdash;“Again.”</p>

<p>The smoker took his pipe from his mouth: “Your
Excellency is, then, General?” The grand air was fast
disappearing.&mdash;“You are coming near it.”&mdash;The major put
his hand to his cap: “Then your Highness is Field-Marshal?”</p>

<p>By this time the grand air had taken flight, and the
officer, so pompous a moment before, looked as if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
steady gaze and the quiet voice of the traveller had
reduced him to the last stage of fear.&mdash;“Once more, my
good major,” said Alexander.&mdash;“His Imperial Majesty?”
exclaimed the man, in surprise and terror, letting his pipe
drop from his trembling fingers.&mdash;“His very self,”
answered the Emperor; and he smiled at the wonderful
change in the major’s face and manner.</p>

<p>“Ah, Sire, pardon me!” cried the officer, falling on his
knees,&mdash;“pardon me!”&mdash;“And what is there to pardon?”
said Alexander, with real, simple dignity. “My friend,
you have done me no harm. I asked you which road I
should take, and you told me. Thanks!”</p>

<p>But the major never forgot the lesson. If, in later years,
he was tempted to be rude or haughty to his so-called
inferiors, there rose at once in his mind a picture of a well-remembered
scene, in which his pride of power had brought
such shame upon him. Two soldiers in a quiet country-town
made but an every-day picture, after all; but what
a difference there had been between the pompous manner
of the petty officer and the natural, courteous dignity of
the Emperor of all the Russias!</p>

<h2><a name="X_THE_POOR_LITTLE_MATCH_GIRL" id="X_THE_POOR_LITTLE_MATCH_GIRL"></a>X.&mdash;THE POOR LITTLE MATCH GIRL.</h2>

<p class="author">Hans Christian Andersen.</p>

<p>It was New Year’s Eve, and a cold, snowy evening.
On this night, a poor little girl walked along the street
with naked feet, benumbed with cold, and carrying in her
hand a bundle of matches, which she had been trying all
day to sell, but in vain; no one had given her a single
penny. The snow fell fast upon her pretty yellow hair
and her bare neck; but she did not mind that. She
looked wistfully at the bright lights which shone from
every window as she passed along; she could smell the
nice roast goose, and she longed to taste it: it was New
Year’s Eve!</p>

<p>Wearied and faint she laid herself down in a corner
of the street, and drew her little legs under her to keep
herself warm. She could not go home, for her father
would scold her for not having sold any matches; and,
even if she were there, she would still be cold, for the
house was but poorly protected, and the wind whistled
through many a chink in the roof and walls. She thought
she would try and warm her cold fingers by lighting one
of the matches; she drew one out, struck it against the
wall, and immediately a bright, clear flame streamed from
it, like a little candle.</p>

<p>The little girl looked at the flame, and she saw before
her a beautiful brass stove with a nice warm fire in it!
She stretched out her feet to warm them,&mdash;when, lo, the
match went out; in a moment the stove and fire vanished;
she sat again in the cold night, with the burnt match in
her hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>She struck another; the flame blazed on the opposite
wall, and she saw through it into a room where a table
was laid out with handsome dishes,&mdash;roast goose, and
other nice things were there,&mdash;and, what was still more
extraordinary, she saw the goose jump from the dish,
knife, and fork, and all, and come running towards her.
But again the match went out; and nothing but the dark
wall and the cold street were to be seen.</p>

<p>The little girl drew another match; and, as soon as it
struck a light, she saw a most beautiful Christmas tree,
much larger and more splendid than any she had ever
seen before. A vast number of lighted candles hung
among the branches; and a multitude of pretty variegated
pictures, like those in the shops, met her eyes.
The girl lifted up her little hands in rapture at the sight;
but again the match fell; and in the same moment one
of the blazing candles shot through the sky, like a falling
star, and fell at her feet. “Now some one dies,” cried
she; for she had been told by her good old grandmother,
that when a star falls, a soul returns to God.</p>

<p>Again she struck; and, behold, a bright light shone
round about her, and in the midst of it stood her kind
grandmother, looking calmly and smilingly upon her.</p>

<p>“Dear grandmother,” said she, “take me, oh take me!
You will be gone from me when the match goes out, like
the bright stove, the nice supper, and the Christmas
tree;” and saying this, she struck all the rest of the
matches at once, which made a light round her almost
like day. And now the good grandmother smiled still
more sweetly upon her; she lifted her up in her arms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
and they soared together, far, far away; where there was
no longer any cold, or hunger, or pain,&mdash;they were in
Paradise!</p>

<p>But the poor little match-girl was still in the corner of
the street, in the cold New Year’s morning. She was
frozen to death, and a bundle of burnt matches lay beside
her. People said, “She has been trying to warm herself,
poor thing!” But ah, they knew not what glorious
things she had seen; they knew not into what joys she
had entered&mdash;nor how happy she was on this festival of
the New Year!</p>

<h2><a name="XII_THE_RHINOCEROS" id="XII_THE_RHINOCEROS"></a>XII.&mdash;THE RHINOCEROS.</h2>

<p>Next to the mighty elephant, the rhinoceros is the
largest and strongest of animals. There are several
species of the rhinoceros, some of which are found in Asia,
and others in different parts of Africa.</p>

<p>In the latter country there are four varieties,&mdash;the black
rhinoceros, having a single horn; a black species, having
two horns; the long-horned white rhinoceros; and the
common white species, which has a short, stubby horn.</p>

<p>The largest of the African species is the long-horned,
white, or square-nosed rhinoceros. When full grown, it
sometimes measures eighteen feet in length, and about as
many feet around the body. Its horn frequently grows
to the length of thirty inches.</p>

<p>The black rhinoceros, although much smaller than the
white, and seldom having a horn over eighteen inches
long, is far more ferocious than the white species, and
possesses a wonderful degree of strength.</p>

<p>The form of the rhinoceros is clumsy, and its appearance
dull and heavy. The limbs are thick and powerful,
and each foot has three toes, which are covered with
broad, hoof-like nails. The tail is small; the head very
long and large. Taken altogether, there are few&mdash;if any&mdash;animals
that compare with the rhinoceros in ugliness.
The eyes are set in such a manner that the animal can
not see anything exactly in front of it; but the senses of
hearing and smelling are so keen that sight is not required
to detect an enemy, whether it be man or beast. The
skin of the African rhinoceros is smooth, and has only a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
few scattering hairs here and there. It is, however, very
thick and tough, and can resist the force of a rifle-ball
except when it is fired from a very short distance.</p>

<p>The largest known species of the rhinoceros is found
in Asia. It lives chiefly in the marshy jungles, and on the
banks of lakes and rivers, in India. Some of this species
are over five feet in height, and have horns three feet in
length and eighteen inches around the base. Unlike that
of the African rhinoceros, the skin of the Asiatic species
is not smooth, but lies in thick folds upon the body,
forming flaps which can be lifted with the hand.</p>

<p>The food of the rhinoceros consists of roots, and the
young branches and leaves of trees and shrubs. It ploughs
up the roots with the aid of its horn, and gathers the
branches and leaves with its upper lip, which is long
and pointed, and with it rolls its food together before
placing it in its mouth. The flesh of the rhinoceros is
good to eat; and its strong, thick skin is made by the
natives into shields, whips, and other articles.</p>

<p>Though clumsy, and apparently very stupid, the rhinoceros
is a very active animal when attacked or otherwise
alarmed. It is very fierce and savage,&mdash;so much so, that
the natives dread it more than they do the lion. In
hunting the rhinoceros, it is dangerous for a man to fire
at one, unless he is mounted upon a swift horse, and can
easily reach some place of safety. When attacking an
enemy, the rhinoceros lowers its head and rushes forward
like an angry bull. Though it may not see the object of
its attack, its sense of smell is so acute that it knows when
the enemy is reached. Then begins a furious tossing of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
the head, and if its powerful horn strikes the foe, a
terrible wound is the result. When wounded itself, the
rhinoceros loses all sense of fear, and charges again and
again, with such desperate fury, that the enemy is almost
always overcome.</p>

<img src="images/p042.jpg" width="423" height="500" alt="Depiction of the hunt described by the famous traveller" />
</div>

<p>A famous traveller in South Africa relates the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
incident that happened during one of his hunting
excursions:</p>

<p>“Having proceeded about two miles, I came upon a
black rhinoceros, feeding within fifty yards of me. I
fired from my saddle, and sent a bullet in behind his
shoulder, upon which he rushed forward, blowing like a
grampus, and then stood looking about him. Presently
he started off, and I followed. I expected that he would
come to bay, but it seems a rhinoceros never does that,&mdash;a
fact I did not know at that time. Suddenly he fell
flat upon the ground; but soon recovering his feet, he
resumed his course as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>“I spurred on my horse, dashed ahead, and rode right
in his path. Upon this, the hideous monster charged me
in the most resolute manner, blowing loudly through his
nostrils. Although I quickly turned about, he followed
me at such a furious pace for several hundred yards, with
his horrid, horny snout within a few yards of my horse’s
tail, that I thought my destruction was certain. The
animal, however, suddenly turned and ran in another
direction. I had now become so excited with the incident,
that I determined to give him one more shot any way.
Nerving my horse again, I made another dash after
the rhinoceros, and coming up pretty close to him, I again
fired, though with little effect, the ball striking some thick
portion of the skin and doing no harm. Not caring to
run the chance of the huge brute again charging me, and
believing that my rifle-ball was not powerful enough to
kill him, I determined to give up the pursuit, and accordingly
let him run off while I returned to the camp.”</p>

<h2><a name="XV_PRINCE_ARTHUR" id="XV_PRINCE_ARTHUR"></a>XV.&mdash;PRINCE ARTHUR.</h2>

<p class="author">Dickens.</p>

<p>At two-and-thirty years of age, in the year 1199, John
became king of England. His pretty little nephew,
Arthur, had the best claim to the throne; but John seized
the treasure, and made fine promises to the nobility, and
got himself crowned at Westminster within a few weeks
after his brother Richard’s death. I doubt whether the
crown could possibly have been put upon the head of a
meaner coward, or a more detestable villain, if the country
had been searched from end to end to find him out.</p>

<p>The French king, Philip, refused to acknowledge the
right of John to his new dignity, and declared in favor
of Arthur. You must not suppose that he had any
generosity of feeling for the fatherless boy; it merely suited
his ambitious schemes to oppose the king of England. So
John and the French king went to war about Arthur.</p>

<p>He was a handsome boy, at that time only twelve years
old. He was not born when his father, Geoffrey, had his
brains trampled out at the tournament; and, besides the
misfortune of never having known a father’s guidance
and protection, he had the additional misfortune to have
a foolish mother (Constance by name), lately married to
her third husband. She took Arthur, upon John’s accession,
to the French king, who pretended to be very much
his friend, and made him a knight, and promised him
his daughter in marriage; but who cared so little about
him in reality, that, finding it his interest to make peace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
with King John for a time, he did so without the least
consideration for the poor little prince, and heartlessly
sacrificed all his interests.</p>

<p>Young Arthur, for two years afterwards, lived quietly,
and in the course of that time his mother died. But the
French king, then finding it his interest to quarrel with
King John again, made Arthur his pretence, and invited
the orphan boy to court. “You know your rights,
prince,” said the French king, “and you would like to be
a king. Is it not so?” “Truly,” said Prince Arthur, “I
should greatly like to be a king!” “Then,” said Philip,
“you shall have two hundred gentlemen who are knights
of mine, and with them you shall go to win back the provinces
belonging to you, of which your uncle, the usurping
king of England, has taken possession. I myself, meanwhile,
will head a force against him in Normandy.”</p>

<p>Prince Arthur went to attack the town of Mirebeau,
because his grandmother, Eleanor, was living there, and
because his knights said, “Prince, if you can take her
prisoner, you will be able to bring the king your uncle to
terms!” But she was not to be easily taken. She was
old enough by this time&mdash;eighty; but she was as full of
stratagem as she was full of years and wickedness. Receiving
intelligence of young Arthur’s approach, she shut
herself up in a high tower, and encouraged her soldiers
to defend it like men. Prince Arthur with his little
army besieged the high tower. King John, hearing how
matters stood, came up to the rescue with his army. So
here was a strange family party! The boy-prince besieging
his grandmother, and his uncle besieging him!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>This position of affairs did not last long. One summer
night, King John, by treachery, got his men into the town,
surprised Prince Arthur’s force, took two hundred of his
knights, and seized the prince himself in his bed. The
knights were put in heavy irons, and driven away in open
carts, drawn by bullocks, to various dungeons, where they
were most inhumanly treated, and where some of them
were starved to death. Prince Arthur was sent to the
Castle of Falaise.</p>

<p>One day, while he was in prison at that castle, mournfully
thinking it strange that one so young should be in
so much trouble, and looking out of the small window in
the deep, dark wall, at the summer sky and the birds, the
door was softly opened, and he saw his uncle, the king,
standing in the shadow of the archway, looking very grim.</p>

<p>“Arthur,” said the king, with his wicked eyes more on
the stone floor than on his nephew, “will you not trust
to the gentleness, the friendship, and the truthfulness of
your loving uncle?” “I will tell my loving uncle that,”
replied the boy, “when he does me right. Let him restore
to me my kingdom of England, and then come to
me and ask the question.” The king looked at him and
went out. “Keep that boy a close prisoner,” said he to
the warden of the castle. Then the king took secret
counsel with the worst of his nobles, how the prince was
to be got rid of. Some said, “Put out his eyes and keep
him in prison, as Robert of Normandy was kept.” Others
said, “Have him stabbed.” Others, “Have him poisoned.”</p>

<p>King John feeling that in any case, whatever was done
afterwards, it would be a satisfaction to his mind to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
those handsome eyes burnt out, that had looked at him
so proudly, while his own royal eyes were blinking at the
stone floor, sent certain ruffians to Falaise to blind the boy
with red-hot irons. But Arthur so pathetically entreated
them, and shed such piteous tears, and so appealed to
Hubert de Bourg (or Burgh), the warden of the castle,
who had a love for him, and was a merciful, tender man,
that Hubert could not bear it. To his eternal honor, he
prevented the torture from being performed; and, at his
own risk sent the savages away.</p>

<p>The chafed and disappointed king bethought himself
of the stabbing suggestion next; and, with his shuffling
manner and his cruel face, proposed it to one William de
Bray. “I am a gentleman, and not an executioner,” said
William de Bray, and left the presence with disdain. But
it was not difficult for a king to hire a murderer in those
days. King John found one for his money, and sent him
down to the castle of Falaise. “On what errand dost thou
come?” said Hubert to this fellow. “To despatch young
Arthur,” he returned. “Go back to him who sent thee,”
answered Hubert, “and say that I will do it!”</p>

<p>King John, very well knowing that Hubert would never
do it, but that he evasively sent this reply to save the
prince or gain time, despatched messengers to convey the
young prisoner to the castle of Rouen. Arthur was soon
forced from the kind Hubert&mdash;of whom he had never
stood in greater need than then&mdash;carried away by night,
and lodged in his new prison; where, through his grated
window, he could hear the deep waters of the river Seine
rippling against the stone wall below.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>One dark night, as he lay sleeping, dreaming, perhaps,
of rescue by those unfortunate gentlemen who were
obscurely suffering and dying in his cause, he was roused,
and bidden by his jailor to come down the staircase to the
foot of the tower. He hurriedly dressed himself, and
obeyed. When they came to the bottom of the winding-stairs,
the jailor trod upon his torch, and put it out. Then
Arthur, in the darkness, was hurriedly drawn into a
solitary boat; and in that boat he found his uncle and
one other man.</p>

<p>He knelt to them, and prayed them not to murder him.
Deaf to his entreaties, they stabbed him, and sank his
body in the river with heavy stones. When the spring
morning broke, the tower-door was closed, the boat was
gone, the river sparkled on its way, and never more was
any trace of the poor boy beheld by mortal eyes.</p>

<h2><a name="XVIII_THE_HIPPOPOTAMUS" id="XVIII_THE_HIPPOPOTAMUS"></a>XVIII.&mdash;THE HIPPOPOTAMUS.</h2>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/p055.jpg" width="400" height="287" alt="Hippopotamus on a river bank, another in the river" />
</div>

<p>Of all the ugly-looking animals the hippopotamus is
certainly one of the ugliest. Its name means the river-horse,
and was given it because it is generally found either
in rivers or their neighborhood, but the hippopotamus is
nothing like a horse, either in its form or its habits.</p>

<p>Though it rarely exceeds five feet in height, it is of vast
bulk, and, when full grown, will weigh, it is said, as much
as four or five oxen. The head is of enormous size, and
provided with a mouth of alarming width. The skin,
which is of a dark color and thinly covered with short
white hairs, is, in places, nearly two inches thick. The
feet are large and divided into four parts, each of which
is protected by a hoof.</p>

<p>The hippopotamus lives entirely upon vegetable food,
of which it eats vast quantities, as much as six bushels of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
grass having been found in its stomach. But it is not so
much the amount of food which it consumes, as what it
destroys, that makes the African dread its visits to the
standing crops. Its body is so huge and its legs are so
short that it tramples down far more than it eats. It is
provided with a tremendous array of teeth, some of which
weigh from five to eight pounds. With these it cuts
down the grass and shrubs on which it lives as if they
were mown with a scythe.</p>

<p>The hippopotamus, in spite of its awkward form, is an
excellent swimmer and diver, and can remain under water
for as much as ten minutes. During the first few months
of its life the young hippopotamus is carried upon its
mother’s neck. When born it is not much larger than a
terrier dog.</p>

<p>The hippopotamus is caught in various ways. Sometimes
several pitfalls, having sharp stakes at the bottom,
are dug across the path which it pursues. In the
darkness of the night it falls into one of these, and is
impaled on the stakes. This is a very cruel mode of
capture, and it is to be hoped that the natives who employ
it, soon put the poor animal out of its misery. It is not
easy to shoot it fatally, for, once it is alarmed, it does not
readily show itself. It just pushes up its nostrils above
the water to take in air, often selecting for this purpose
some spot where the reeds conceal its movements, and
then sinks again. Sometimes the hippopotamus is harpooned
like a whale. As soon as it is struck with the
harpoon the hunters fasten the line round a neighboring
tree, and so hold their prey tight until it is despatched.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Or, if there is no time for them to get to land, they throw
the line, with a buoy attached to it, into the water. The
hippopotamus is then pursued in canoes, and every time
it rises to the surface it is pierced with javelins, until, at
length, it dies from loss of blood. This is dangerous sport,
for it sometimes turns upon the hunters and crushes in or
capsizes their canoes. Once a hippopotamus, whose calf
had been speared on the previous day, attacked a boat in
which was Dr. Livingstone. She struck it with such
violence that the forepart was lifted clean out of the
water, one of the negro boatmen was thrown into the
river, and the whole crew were forced to jump ashore.</p>

<p>Between the skin and the flesh is a layer of fat, which
is considered a great delicacy. The flesh also is very good
eating. The hide is made into shields, whips, and walking-sticks.
The teeth yield a beautiful white ivory, which is
much valued on account of its never losing color.</p>

<p>King Edward I. of England, commonly known as
“Longshanks,” nearly conquered Scotland. It was from
no lack of spirit or energy that he did not quite complete
his troublesome task, but he died a little too soon. On
his death-bed he called his pretty, spiritless son to him, and
made him promise to carry on the war; he then ordered
that his bones should be wrapped up in a bull’s hide, and
carried at the head of the army in future campaigns against
the Scots. Edward II. soon forgot his promise to his
father, and spent his time in dissipation among his favorites,
and allowed the resolute Scots to recover Scotland.</p>

<p>Good James, Lord Douglas, was a very wise man in his
day. He may not have had long shanks, but he had a very

hardest foes with which the two Edwards had to contend,
and his long head proved quite too powerful for the second
Edward, who, in his single campaign against the Scots,
lost at Bannockburn nearly all that his father had gained.</p>

<p>The tall Scottish castle of Roxburgh stood near the
border, lifting its grim turrets above the Teviot and the
Tweed. When the Black Douglas, as Lord James was
called, had recovered castle after castle from the English,
he desired to gain this stronghold, and determined to
accomplish his wish. But he knew it could be taken
only by surprise, and a very wily affair it must be. He
had outwitted the English so many times that they were
sharply on the look out for him.</p>

<p>How could it be done?</p>

<p>’Tis an old Yule-log story, and you shall be told.</p>

<p>Near the castle was a gloomy old forest, called Jedburgh.
Here, just as the first days of spring began to
kindle in the sunrise and the sunsets, and warm the frosty
hills, Black Douglas concealed sixty picked men.</p>

<p>It was Shrove-tide, and Fasten’s Eve, immediately
before the great Church fast of Lent, was to be celebrated
with song and harp and a great blaze of light, and free
offerings of wine in the great hall of the castle. The
garrison was to have leave for merry-making and
indulging in drunken wassail.</p>

<p>The sun had gone down in the red sky, and the long,
deep shadow began to fall on Jedburgh woods, the river,
the hills, and valleys. An officer’s wife had retired from
the great hall, where all was preparation for the merry-making,
to the high battlements of the castle, in order to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
quiet her little child and put it to rest. The sentinel,
from time to time, paced near her. She began to sing:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Hush ye, hush ye, little pet ye!</div>
<div class="verse">Hush ye, hush ye, do not fret ye;</div>
<div class="verse">The Black Douglas shall not get ye!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>She saw some strange objects moving across the level
ground in the distance. They greatly puzzled her. They
did not travel quite like animals, but they seemed to have
four legs.</p>

<p>“What are those queer-looking things yonder?” she
asked of the sentinel as he drew near.</p>

<p>“They are Farmer Asher’s cattle,” said the soldier,
straining his eyes to discern the outlines of the long figures
in the shadows. “The good man is making merry to-night,
and has forgotten to bring in his oxen; lucky
’twill be if they do not fall a prey to the Black Douglas.”</p>

<p>So sure was he that the objects were cattle, that he
ceased to watch them longer.</p>

<p>The woman’s eye, however, followed the queer-looking
cattle for some time, until they seemed to disappear under
the outer works of the castle. Then feeling quite at ease,
she thought she would sing again. Spring was in the
evening air; and, perhaps, it was the joyousness of spring
which made her sing.</p>

<p>Now, the name of the Black Douglas had become so
terrible to the English that it was used to frighten the
children, who, when they misbehaved, were told that the
Black Douglas would get them. The little ditty I have
quoted must have been very quieting to good children in
those alarming times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>So the good woman sang cheerily:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Hush ye, hush ye, little pet ye!</div>
<div class="verse">Hush ye, hush ye, do not fret ye:</div>
<div class="verse">The Black Douglas shall not get ye!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Do not be so sure of that,” said a husky voice close
beside her, and a mail-gloved hand fell solidly upon her
shoulder. She was dreadfully frightened, for she knew
from the appearance of the man he must be the Black
Douglas.</p>

<p>The Scots came leaping over the walls. The garrison
was merry making below, and, almost before the disarmed
revellers had any warning, the Black Douglas was in the
midst of them. The old stronghold was taken, and many
of the garrison were put to the sword; but the Black
Douglas spared the woman and the child, who probably
never afterwards felt quite so sure about the little ditty:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Hush ye, hush ye, do not fret ye:</div>
<div class="verse">The Black Douglas shall not get ye!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Douglas had caused his picked men to approach the
castle by walking on their hands and knees, with long
black cloaks thrown over their bodies, and their ladders
and weapons concealed under their cloaks. The men
thus presented very nearly the appearance of a herd of
cattle in the deep shadows, and completely deceived the
sentinel, who was probably thinking more of the music
and dancing below, than of the watchful enemy who had
been haunting the gloomy woods of Jedburgh.</p>

<p>The Black Douglas, or “Good James, Lord Douglas,” as
he was called by the Scots, fought, as you will afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
read, with King Robert Bruce at Bannockburn. One
lovely June day, in the far-gone year of 1329, King
Robert lay dying. He called Douglas to his bedside, and
told him that it had been one of the dearest wishes of his
heart to go to the Holy Land, and recover Jerusalem from
the Infidels; but since he could not go, he wished him to
embalm his heart after his death, and carry it to the Holy
City, and deposit it in the Holy Sepulchre.</p>

<p>Douglas had the heart of Bruce embalmed and enclosed
in a silver case, and wore it on a silver chain
about his neck. He set out for Jerusalem, but resolved
first to visit Spain and engage in the war waged against
the Moorish king of Granada. He fell in Andalusia, in
battle. Just before his death he threw the silver casket
into the thickest of the fight, exclaiming, “Heart of
Bruce, I follow thee or die!”</p>

<p>His dead body was found beside the casket, and the
heart of Bruce was brought back to Scotland and
deposited in the ivy-clad Abbey of Melrose.</p>

<p>Douglas was a real hero, and few things more engaging
than his exploits were ever told under the holly and
mistletoe, or in the warm Christmas light of the old
Scottish Yule-logs.</p>

<div class="verse">Now just at the moment a spider dropped, with its silken cobweb clew,</div>

<div class="stanza">

<h2><a name="XXIII_THE_FARMER_AND_THE_FOX" id="XXIII_THE_FARMER_AND_THE_FOX"></a>XXIII.&mdash;THE FARMER AND THE FOX.</h2>

<p class="author">J. A. Froude.</p>

<p>A Farmer, whose poultry-yard had suffered severely
from the foxes, succeeded at last in catching one in a trap.</p>

<p>“Ah, you rascal!” said he, as he saw him struggling,
“I’ll teach you to steal my fat geese. You shall hang on
the tree yonder, and your brothers shall see what comes
of thieving.”</p>

<p>The Farmer was twisting a halter to do what he had
threatened, when the Fox, whose tongue had helped him
in hard pinches before, thought there could be no harm
in trying if it might not do him one more good turn.</p>

<p>“You will hang me,” he said, “to frighten my brother
foxes. On the word of a fox they won’t care a rabbit-skin
for it; they’ll come and look at me, but you may
depend upon it, they will dine at your expense before
they go home again!”</p>

<p>“Then I shall hang you for yourself, as a rogue and a
rascal,” said the Farmer.</p>

<p>“I am only what Nature, or whatever you call the
thing, chose to make me,” the Fox answered; “I didn’t
make myself.”</p>

<p>“You stole my geese,” said the man.</p>

<p>“Why did Nature make me like geese, then?” said the
Fox. “Live and let live; give me my share and I won’t
touch yours; but you keep them all to yourself.”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand your fine talk,” answered the
Farmer; “but I know that you are a thief, and that
you deserve to be hanged.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>His head is too thick to let me catch him so, thought
the Fox; I wonder if his heart is any softer. “You are
taking away the life of a fellow-creature,” he said;
“that’s a responsibility,&mdash;it is a curious thing that life,
and who knows what comes after it? You say I am a
rogue; I say I am not; but at any rate I ought not to be
hanged, for if I am not, I don’t deserve it; and if I am,
you should give me time to repent.” I have him now,
thought the Fox; let him get out if he can.</p>

<p>“Why, what would you have me do with you?” said
the man.</p>

<p>“My notion is, that you should let me go, and give me
a lamb, or a goose or two, every month, and then I could
live without stealing; but perhaps you know better than
I, and I am a rogue; my education may have been neglected;
you should shut me up, and take care of me, and
teach me. Who knows but in the end I may turn into a
dog?”</p>

<p>“Very pretty,” said the Farmer; “we have dogs
enough, and more, too, than we can take care of, without
you. No, no, Master Fox; I have caught you, and you
shall swing, whatever is the logic of it. There will be
one rogue less in the world, any how.”</p>

<p>“It is mere hate and unchristian vengeance,” said the
Fox.</p>

<p>“No, friend,” the Farmer answered, “I don’t hate you,
and I don’t want to revenge myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span> on you; but you and
I can’t get on together, and I think I am of more importance
than you. If nettles and thistles grow in my cabbage-garden,
I don’t try and persuade them to grow into
cabbages. I just dig them up. I don’t hate them; but I
feel somehow that they mustn’t hinder me with my cabbage,
and that I must put them away; and so, my poor
friend, I am sorry for you, but I am afraid you must
swing.”</p>

<h2><a name="XXVI_HOLLAND" id="XXVI_HOLLAND"></a>XXVI.&mdash;HOLLAND.</h2>

<p class="author">Mary Mapes Dodge.</p>

<p>Dutch cities seem, at first sight, to be a bewildering
jumble of houses, bridges, churches, and ships, sprouting
into masts, steeples, and trees. In some cities boats are
hitched, like horses, to their owners’ door-posts, and
receive their freight from the upper windows.</p>

<p>Mothers scream to their children not to swing on
the garden gate for fear they may be drowned. Water
roads are more frequent in Holland than common roads
and railroads; water fences, in the form of lazy green
ditches, enclose pleasure-ground, farm, and garden.</p>

<p>Sometimes fine green hedges are seen; but wooden
fences, such as we have, are rarely met with in Holland.
As for stone fences, a Hollander would lift his hands
with astonishment at the very idea. There is no stone
there, excepting those great, masses of rock that have
been brought from other lands, to strengthen and protect
the coast. All the small stones or pebbles, if there
ever were any, seem to be imprisoned in pavements
or quite melted away. Boys, with strong, quick arms,
may grow from aprons to full beards, without ever finding
one to start the water-rings, or set the rabbits flying.</p>

<p>The water-roads are nothing less than canals crossing
the country in every direction. These are of all sizes,
from the great North Holland Ship Canal, which is the
wonder of the world, to those which a boy can leap.
Water-omnibuses constantly ply up and down these
roads for the conveyance of passengers; and water-drays<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
are used for carrying fuel and merchandise.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 375px;">
<img src="images/p079.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="A canal-side scene: boats, horse and cart, people carrying baskets" />
</div>

<p>Instead of green country lanes, green canals stretch
from field to barn, and from barn to garden; and the
farms are merely great lakes pumped dry. Some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
busiest streets are water, while many of the country roads
are paved with brick. The city boats, with their rounded
sterns, gilded bows, and gayly-painted sides, are unlike
any others under the sun; a Dutch waggon, with its funny
little crooked pole, is a perfect mystery of mysteries.</p>

<p>One thing is clear, you may think that the inhabitants
need never be thirsty. But no, Odd-land is true to itself
still. With the sea pushing to get in, and the lakes
struggling to get out, and the overflowing canals, rivers,
and ditches, in many districts there is no water that is fit
to swallow. Our poor Hollanders must go dry, or send
far inland for that precious fluid, older than Adam, yet
young as the morning dew. Sometimes, indeed, the
inhabitants can swallow a shower, when they are provided
with any means of catching it; but generally they
are like the sailors told of in a famous poem, who saw</p>

<p>Great flapping windmills all over the country make it
look as if flocks of huge sea-birds were just settling upon
it. Everywhere one sees the funniest trees, bobbed into
all sorts of odd shapes, with their trunks painted a
dazzling white, yellow, or red.</p>

<p>Horses are often yoked three abreast. Men, women
and children go clattering about in wooden shoes with
loose heels.</p>

<p>Husbands and wives lovingly harness themselves side
by side on the bank of the canal and drag their produce
to market.</p>

<h2><a name="XXIX_THE_HEROIC_SERF" id="XXIX_THE_HEROIC_SERF"></a>XXIX.&mdash;THE HEROIC SERF.</h2>

<p>In the dark forests of Russia, where the snow lies on
the ground for eight months in the year, wolves roam
about in countless troops; and it is a fearful thing for
the traveller, especially if night overtakes him, to hear
their famished howlings as they approach nearer and
nearer to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>A Russian nobleman, with his wife and a young
daughter, was travelling in a sleigh over a bleak plain.
About nightfall they reached an inn, and the nobleman
called for a relay of horses to go on. The innkeeper
begged him not to proceed. “There is danger ahead,”
said he: “the wolves are out.” The traveller thought the
object of the man was to keep him as a guest for the
night, and, saying it was too early in the season for
wolves, ordered the horses to be put to. In spite of the
repeated warnings of the landlord, the party proceeded
on their way.</p>

<p>The driver was a serf who had been born on the nobleman’s
estate, and who loved his master as he loved his
life. The sleigh sped swiftly over the hard snow, and there
seemed no signs of danger. The moon began to shed her
light, so that the road seemed like polished silver.</p>

<p>Suddenly the little girl said to her father, “What is
that strange, dull sound I heard just now?” Her father
replied, “Nothing but the wind sighing through the trees.”</p>

<p>The child shut her eyes, and kept still for a while; but
in a few minutes, with a face pale with fear, she turned
to her father, and said, “Surely that is not the wind: I
hear it again; do you not hear it too? Listen!” The
nobleman listened, and far, far away in the distance
behind him, but distinct enough in the clear, frosty air, he
heard a sound of which he knew the meaning, though
those who were with him did not.</p>

<p>Whispering to the serf, he said, “They are after us.
Get ready your musket and pistols; I will do the same.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
We may yet escape. Drive on! drive on!”</p>

<p>The man drove wildly on; but nearer, ever nearer,
came the mournful howling which the child had first
heard. It was perfectly clear to the nobleman that a
pack of wolves had got scent, and was in pursuit of them.
Meanwhile he tried to calm the anxious fears of his wife
and child.</p>

<p>At last the baying of the wolves was distinctly heard,
and he said to his servant, “When they come up with us,
single you out the leader, and fire. I will single out the
next; and, as soon as one falls, the rest will stop to devour
him. <i>That</i> will be some delay, at least.”</p>

<p>By this time they could see the pack fast approaching,
with their long, measured tread. A large dog-wolf was
the leader. The nobleman and the serf singled out two,
and these fell. The pack immediately turned on their
fallen comrades, and soon tore them to pieces. The taste
of blood only made the others advance with more fury,
and they were soon again baying at the sleigh. Again
the nobleman and his servant fired. Two other wolves
fell, and were instantly devoured. But the next post-house
was still far distant.</p>

<p>The nobleman then cried to the post-boy, “Let one of
the horses loose, that we may gain a little more time.”
This was done, and the horse was left on the road. In a
few minutes they heard the loud shrieks of the poor
animal as the wolves tore him down. The remaining
horses were urged to their utmost speed, but again the
pack was in full pursuit. Another horse was cut loose,
and he soon shared the fate of his fellow.</p>

<p>At length the servant said to his master, “I have
served you since I was a child, and I love you as I love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
my own life. It is clear to me that we can not all reach
the post-house alive. I am quite prepared, and I ask
you to let me die for you.”</p>

<p>“No, no!” cried the master, “we will live together
or die together. You must not, must not!”</p>

<p>But the servant had made up his mind; he was fully
resolved. “I shall leave my wife and children to you;
you will be a father to them: you have been a father to
me. When the wolves next reach us, I will jump down,
and do my best to delay their progress.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/p085.jpg" width="400" height="231" alt="The master whips his horses on, as wolves pursue the sleigh" />
</div>

<p>The sleigh glides on as fast as the two remaining
horses can drag it. The wolves are close on their track,
and almost up with them. But what sound now rings
out sharp and loud? It is the discharge of the servant’s
pistol. At the same instant he leaps from his seat, and
falls a prey to the wolves! But meanwhile the post-house
is reached, and the family is safe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>On the spot where the wolves had pulled to pieces the
devoted servant, there now stands a large wooden cross,
erected by the nobleman. It bears this inscription:
“<i>Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay
down his life for his friends.</i>”</p>

<h2><a name="XXXII_THE_OTTER" id="XXXII_THE_OTTER"></a>XXXII.&mdash;THE OTTER.</h2>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/p090.jpg" width="300" height="280" alt="Two otters on rocks by the riverside" />
</div>

<p>The otter resembles land animals in shape, hair, and
general conformation, and the aquatic tribes in its manner
of living and in its webbed toes, which assist it in
swimming. It swims even faster than it runs, and can
overtake fishes in their own element.</p>

<p>It is found in all parts of the world,&mdash;on tropical islands,
in America, and on the bleak coasts of Alaska and Siberia.
It is one of the great weasel family, as active and cunning
in the water, as its land relations are in the field, or in
the farm-yard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>The fish-otter&mdash;which is found around lakes and rivers
in Canada, in the United States, in South America, and
in wild parts of Europe&mdash;is a famous fisher. Its home is in
the water, but it can travel over the land with wonderful
swiftness, although its paws are webbed.</p>

<p>It is very fond of sliding down hill. On the slopes by
ponds and rivers, it enjoys itself in a very odd fashion.
It lies with its fore-feet bent backward, and pushes itself
forward with its hind-feet, going down the snowy or
muddy slope with as much pleasure as if it were a schoolboy
“coasting.” A number of fish-otters thus amusing
themselves must present a very ludicrous sight.</p>

<p>These furry little quadrupeds can stay a long time under
water, swimming swiftly and without noise; so that the
fish they follow seldom escape them. If the prey is small,
the otters do not trouble themselves to go far with it, but
bite off the most delicate morsels and throw the rest away.
When they catch a large fish, however, they drag it ashore
and feed upon it at their leisure. When fish are not
plentiful enough, the otters, grown bold from necessity,
will attack ducks or any other waterfowl within reach.
They are so strong, and bite so fiercely, that the animals
they pursue may well regard them with terror.</p>

<p>Their habitations are really safe hiding-places. They
burrow under the ground, and make the entrance of their
“nest” under water; so that no land-enemies can pursue
them: certainly, no water-foe can follow them into the
hollow made by them in the bank. This proves that the
crafty nature of the weasel is not wanting in the otter.</p>

<p>They dig upward four or five feet, or even more; and at
the end of the tunnel they make a little room, which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
line with moss and grass, for the comfort of the baby-otters.
This underground room has no need of windows;
but it does need ventilation, and a minute air-hole, leading,
like a chimney, to the surface of the earth, is an important
part of otter house-building.</p>

<p>When taken young, otters can be tamed and taught to
catch fish for their masters, being trained to hunt as dogs
are trained for the chase. “I have seen one,” says Goldsmith,
“go to a gentleman’s pond at the word of command,
drive up the fish into a corner, and, having seized upon
the largest, bring it off in its mouth to its master.”</p>

<p>Otters differ very much in size and color. Fish-otters
are from two to three feet long, and sea-otters&mdash;the largest
of the family&mdash;are somewhat longer. These sea-otters are
very much prized for their soft, glossy, black fur. Some
of the species, however are white, with a yellow tinge;
others are dark-brown, with yellow spots under the throat.
No doubt all of you have seen caps, and gloves, and
other coverings made of the soft, warm fur of the otter.</p>

<h2><a name="XXXVI_A_CHILDS_DREAM_OF_A_STAR" id="XXXVI_A_CHILDS_DREAM_OF_A_STAR"></a>XXXVI.&mdash;A CHILD’S DREAM OF A STAR.</h2>

<p class="author">Charles Dickens.</p>

<p>There was once a child, and he strolled about a good
deal, and thought of a number of things. He had a
sister, who was a child too, and his constant companion.
These two used to wonder all day long. They wondered
at the beauty of the flowers; they wondered at the height
and blueness of the sky; they wondered at the goodness
and the power of God, who made the lovely world.</p>

<p>They used to say to one another sometimes, “Supposing
all the children upon earth were to die, would the
flowers, and the water, and the sky be sorry?” They
believed they would be sorry. “For,” said they, “the
buds are the children of the flowers, and the little playful
streams that gambol down the hillsides are the children
of the water; and the smallest bright specks, playing at
hide-and-seek in the sky all night, must surely be the
children of the stars; and they would all be grieved to
see their playmates, the children of men, no more.”</p>

<p>There was one clear-shining star that used to come out
in the sky before the rest, near the church spire, above the
graves. It was larger and more beautiful, they thought,
than all the others, and every night they watched for it,
standing hand in hand at a window. Whoever saw it
first cried out, “I see the star!” And often they cried
out both together, knowing so well when it would rise,
and where. So they grew to be such friends with it, that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
before lying down on their beds, they always looked out
once again, to bid it good-night; and when they were turning
round to sleep they used to say, “God bless the star!”</p>

<p>But while she was still very young&mdash;oh, very, very
young!&mdash;the sister drooped, and came to be so weak, that
she could no longer stand at the window at night; and
then the child looked sadly out by himself, and when he
saw the star, turned round and said to the patient, pale
face on the bed, “I see the star!” and then a smile would
come upon the face, and a little, weak voice used to say,
“God bless my brother and the star!”</p>

<p>And so the time came, all too soon! when the child
looked out alone, and when there was no face on the bed;
and when there was a little grave among the graves, not
there before; and when the star made long rays down
towards him, as he saw it through his tears.</p>

<p>Now, these rays were so bright, and they seemed to
make such a shining way from earth to heaven, that when
the child went to his solitary bed, he dreamed about the
star; and dreamed that, lying where he was, he saw a
train of people taken up that sparkling road by angels.
And the star, opening, showed him a great world of light,
where many more such angels waited to receive him.</p>

<p>All these angels, who were waiting, turned their beaming
eyes upon the people who were carried up into the
star; and some came out from the long rows in which
they stood, and fell upon the people’s necks, and kissed
them tenderly, and went away with them down avenues
of light, and were so happy in their company, that, lying
in his bed, he wept for joy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>But there were many angels who did not go with them,
and among them one he knew. The patient face that
once had lain upon the bed was glorified and radiant, but
his heart found out his sister among all the host. His
sister’s angel lingered near the entrance of the star, and
said to the leader among those who had brought the
people thither, “Is my brother come?” And he said,
“No.” She was turning hopefully away, when the child
stretched out his arms, and cried, “O sister, I am here!
Take me!” And then she turned her beaming eyes upon
him, and it was night; and the star was shining into the
room, making long rays down towards him, as he saw it
through his tears. From that hour forth, the child looked
out upon the star as on the Home he was to go to when
his time should come; and he thought that he did not
belong to the earth alone, but to the star too, because of
his sister’s angel gone before. There was a baby born to
be a brother to the child; and while he was so little that
he never yet had spoken a word, he stretched his tiny
form out on the bed, and died.</p>

<p>Again the child dreamed of the opened star, and of the
company of angels, and the train of people, and the rows
of angels, with their beaming eyes all turned upon those
people’s faces. Said his sister’s angel to the leader, “Is
my brother come?” And he said, “Not that one, but
another.” As the child beheld his brother’s angel in her
arms, he cried, “O sister, I am here! Take me!” And she
turned and smiled upon him, and the star was shining.</p>

<p>He grew to be a young man, and was busy at his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
books, when an old servant came to him, and said, “Thy
mother is no more. I bring her blessing on her darling
son!” Again at night he saw the star, and all the former
company. Said his sister’s angel to the leader, “Is my
brother come?” And he said, “Thy mother!” A mighty
cry of joy went forth through all the star, because the
mother was reunited to her two children. And he
stretched out his arms, and cried, “O mother, sister, and
brother, I am here! Take me!” And they answered
him, “Not yet,” and the star was shining.</p>

<p>He grew to be a man, whose hair was turning gray,
and he was sitting in his chair by the fireside, heavy
with grief, and with his face bedewed with tears, when
the star opened once again. Said his sister’s angel to
the leader, “Is my brother come?” And he said, “Nay,
but his maiden daughter.” And the man who had been
the child saw his daughter, newly lost to him, a celestial
creature among those three, and he said, “My daughter’s
head is on my sister’s bosom, and her arm is round my
mother’s neck, and at her feet there is the baby of old
time, and I can bear the parting from her&mdash;God be
praised!” And the star was shining.</p>

<p>Thus the child came to be an old man, and his face was
wrinkled, and his steps were slow, and his back was bent.
And one night, as he lay upon his bed, his children
standing around, he cried, as he had cried so long ago,
“I see the star!” They whispered to one another, “He
is dying.” And he said, “I am. My age is falling from
me like a garment, and I move towards the star as a child.
And, O my Father, now I thank Thee that it has so often
opened, to receive those dear ones who await me!” And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
the star was shining; and it shines upon his grave.</p>

<h2><a name="XXXIX_THE_BEAVER" id="XXXIX_THE_BEAVER"></a>XXXIX.&mdash;THE BEAVER.</h2>

<p>There are few animals
that can teach us
more useful lessons than
the beaver.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 346px;">
<img src="images/p106.jpg" width="346" height="400" alt="Beavers gnawing through a treetrunk" />
</div>

<p>They are very timid
animals. If we went to
places where they are common, it would be very difficult
to find them and see what they do.</p>

<p>The beaver is between two and three feet long, and one
foot high, and is covered with brown hair. Its eyes are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
very small and far apart; its ears also are small and its nose
blunt. It has very strong, sharp teeth, and a long tail
shaped somewhat like the blade of an oar. This tail has
no hair or fur on it, but is covered with little scales like
those of a fish. The hind feet of the beaver have a thin
skin between the toes. This shows that the beaver is
fitted for swimming. During the summer these animals
live in holes near the banks of rivers. They are very
social animals. They never live alone. They usually go
in parties, and build a little “beaver town.” They have
some means of making known their wants to each other.
They know they will be safer in water than on land, so
they try to find a pond where they can build their town.
If they can not do this, they will choose a running stream
with some trees on the banks.</p>

<p>The first thing they do, is to make a dam, right across
the stream. They have neither saws nor hatchets with
which to cut down the trees; but they use their sharp,
strong teeth, and gnaw and gnaw away, until they bring
down tree after tree. These little wood-cutters know
very well how to do this; otherwise the trees might fall
and kill them. When they have gnawed nearly through
the trunk, away they run to see if the tree is beginning to
bend. If it is still straight, they set to work again; but
the moment they hear it crack, off they run to keep out
of danger.</p>

<p>When the tree is down, they gnaw off all the branches
in the same way, and then cut the trunk into short pieces,
and roll them down to the water’s edge. Then they go to
work at another tree, and still another, until they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span> have
cut down all they want. These logs of wood, kept in
their places by mud and stones, make a dam, and this
dam stops the water and causes it to rise around their
houses and cover the openings which are at the bottom,
and helps to keep them safe from danger.</p>

<p>Then the houses are built of mud, stones, sticks, and
small branches twined in and out to keep them fast. These
houses are several feet high and are very thick. There
are two rooms in them, one at the bottom, under water,
which they use for a store-room, and the other, at the
top, above the water, for a living-room. The floor of this
room is covered with soft moss.</p>

<p>But these wise beavers know that they must have a
store of food for the winter, as well as a snug little house
to live in. They gather logs of wood and branches, and
put them away in their store-room. The bark of these
logs and some water plants supply them with food.
When they are “at home” during the winter months
in their “beaver town,” they always have a sentinel to
keep watch, and if any one comes near, he gives the
alarm by striking the water with his broad, flat tail.</p>

<p>There are no idle beavers. They not only work hard,
but with great skill and care.</p>

<h2><a name="XLII_A_NARROW_ESCAPE" id="XLII_A_NARROW_ESCAPE"></a>XLII.&mdash;A NARROW ESCAPE.</h2>

<p>In 1843, Livingstone, the celebrated traveller, settled
as a missionary in Mabtosa, a beautiful valley in South
Africa. Here he met with an adventure which nearly
terminated his earthly career.</p>

<p>The natives of Mabtosa had long been troubled by lions,
which invaded their cattle-pens by night, and even
attacked the herds during the day. These poor people,
being very ignorant and superstitious, thought that the
inroads of the lions were caused by witchcraft. It was
perhaps for this reason that all their attempts to drive
away the animals were feeble and faint-hearted, and therefore
unsuccessful.</p>

<p>It is well known that a troop of lions will not remain
long in any district where one of their number has been
killed. So the next time the herds of Mabtosa were
attacked, Livingstone went out with the natives to
encourage them to destroy one of the marauders, and
thus free themselves from the whole troop. They found
the lions on a small hill covered with wood. The hunters
placed themselves in a circle round the hill, and began to
ascend, coming gradually closer to each other as they
approached the summit.</p>

<p>Livingstone remained, along with a native teacher, on
the plain below, to watch the manœuvres of the party.
His companion, seeing one of the lions sitting on a piece
of rock within the circle of hunters, took aim and fired;
but the ball only struck the stones at the animal’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
feet. With a roar of rage the fierce brute bounded
away, broke through the ring, and escaped unhurt, the
natives not having the courage to stand close and spear
him as he passed.</p>

<p>The band again closed in and resumed their march.
There were still two lions in the wood, and it was hoped
that fortune would favor a second attempt to destroy one
of them. But suddenly a terrific roar echoed from the
hill, and the timid hunters quaked with fear. First one
of the lions, and then the other, with streaming manes and
glaring eyes, rushed down through the wavering ranks,
and bounded away, free to continue their devastations.</p>

<p>As the party were returning home, bewailing their want
of success, Livingstone observed one of the lions about
thirty yards in front, sitting on a rock behind a bush.
Raising his gun, he took steady aim, and discharged both
barrels into the thicket. “He is shot! He is shot!” was
the joyful cry; and some of the men were about to rush
in and despatch the wounded beast with their spears.
But Livingstone, seeing the lion’s tail erected in anger,
warned them to keep back until he had fired a second
time. He was just in the act of reloading, when, hearing
a shout of terror, he looked round and saw the lion
preparing to spring. It was too late to retreat. With a
savage growl the frenzied animal seized him by the
shoulder, and shook him as a terrier shakes a rat. The
shock caused a momentary anguish, followed by a sort of
drowsiness, in which he had no sense of pain nor feeling
of terror, though he knew all that was happening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/p113.jpg" width="400" height="500" alt="Above: Lion at rest. Below: Lion being hunted." />
</div>

<p>The lion’s paw was resting on the back of his head, and
as he turned round to relieve himself of the pressure, he
saw the creature’s fiery eyes directed to the native teacher,
who, at a distance of ten or fifteen yards, was making
ready to shoot. The gun missed fire in both barrels; and
the lion sprang at his new assailant, and bit him in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
thigh. Another man also, who was standing near, was
severely bitten in the shoulder; but at this moment the
bullets took effect, and the huge beast fell back dead.</p>

<p>All this occurred in a few seconds: the death-blow had
been inflicted before the animal sprang upon his assailants.
Livingstone’s arm was wounded in eleven places, and the
bone crushed into splinters; and the injuries might have
proved fatal but for his tartan jacket, which wiped the
poison from the lion’s teeth before they entered the flesh.</p>

<p>It was long ere the wounds healed, and all through life
the intrepid missionary bore the marks of this dreadful
encounter. Thirty years afterwards, when his noble and
useful career had ended among the swamps of Central
Africa, and his remains were taken to England to be
interred in Westminster Abbey, the crushed and mangled
arm was one of the marks which enabled his sorrowing
friends in that country to identify the body as that of
David Livingstone.</p>

</div>

<p>In various parts of the earth, there are mountains that
send out from their highest peaks, smoke, ashes, and fire.
Mountains of this class are called volcanoes, and they
present a striking contrast to other mountains, on account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
of their conical form and the character of the rocks of
which they are composed. All volcanoes have at their
summits what are called craters. These are large, hollow,
circular openings, from which the smoke and fire escape.</p>

<p>Nearly all volcanoes emit smoke constantly. This
smoke proceeds from fires that are burning far down in
the depths of the earth. Sometimes these fires burst
forth from the crater of the volcano with tremendous
force. The smoke becomes thick and black, and lurid
flames shoot up to a height of hundreds of feet, making a
scene of amazing grandeur. With the flames there are
thrown out stones, ashes, and streams of melted rock
called lava. This lava flows down the sides of the
mountain, and, being red hot, destroys everything with
which it comes in contact. At such times, a volcano is
said to be in eruption. Such is the force of some of
these eruptions, that large rocks have been hurled to
great distances from the crater, and towns and cities have
been buried under a vast covering of ashes and lava.</p>

<p>The quantity of lava and ashes which sometimes
escapes from volcanoes during an eruption, is almost
beyond comprehension. In 1772, a volcano in the island
of Java, threw out ashes and cinders that covered the
ground fifty feet deep, for a distance of seven miles all
around the mountain. This eruption destroyed nearly
forty towns and villages. In 1783, a volcano in Iceland
sent out two streams of lava; one forty miles long and
seven miles wide, and the other fifty miles long and
fifteen miles wide. These streams were from one hundred
to six hundred feet deep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>Near the city of Naples, in Italy, is situated the volcano
Mt. Vesuvius. This fiery monster has probably caused
more destruction than any other volcano known. In the
year 79, A.D., it suddenly burst forth in a violent eruption,
that resulted in one of the most appalling disasters that
ever happened. Such immense quantities of ashes, stones,
and lava were poured forth from its crater, that within
twenty hours, two large cities were completely destroyed.
These cities were Herculaneum and Pompeii.</p>

<p>At this eruption of Vesuvius, the stream of lava flowed
directly through and over the city of Herculaneum into
the sea. The quantity was so great that, as it cooled and
became hardened, it gradually filled up all the streets and
ran over the tops of the houses. While the lava was
thus turning the city into a mass of solid stone, the
inhabitants were fleeing from it along the shore toward
Naples, and in boats on the sea. At the same time, too,
the wind carried the ashes and cinders in such a direction
as to deluge the city of Pompeii. Slowly and steadily the
immense volume of ashes and small stones, blocked up
the streets and settled on the roofs of the houses. The
light of the flames that burst out from the awful crater,
aided the people in their escape; but many who for some
reason could not get away, perished.</p>

<p>Pompeii was so completely covered that nothing could
be seen of it. Thus it remained, buried under the ground,
until the year 1748, when it was discovered by accident.
Since that time much of the city has been uncovered,
and now one can walk along the streets, look into the
houses, and form some idea how the people lived there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>

<h2><a name="XLVI_CURIOUS_BIRDS_NESTS" id="XLVI_CURIOUS_BIRDS_NESTS"></a>XLVI.&mdash;CURIOUS BIRDS’ NESTS.</h2>

<p>Among the most curious nests are those made by the
birds called weavers. These feathered workmen serve
no apprenticeship: their trade comes to them by nature;
and how well they work at it! But then you must admit
that Nature is a skilful teacher and birds are apt scholars.</p>

<p>The Baltimore oriole is a weaver, and it makes its nest
out of bark, fine grass, moss, and wool, strengthening it,
when circumstances permit, with pieces of string or horsehair.
This nest, pouch-shaped, and open at the top, is
fastened to the branch of a tree, and is sometimes interwoven
with the twigs of a waving bough. The threads
of grass and long fibres of moss, are woven together, in
and out, as if by machinery; and it seems hard to believe
that the little birds can do such work without help.</p>

<p>The long, slender boughs of the willow are the favorite
resort of the oriole; and here, in the midst of a storm,
the bird may sit in its swinging nest, fearing no danger.
What is there to dread? The trees rock in the wind, but
the oriole’s habitation is strong and well secured. Unless
the branch from which the nest hangs be torn from the
tree, the nest will endure the tempest and prove a safe
shelter for the blithe little bird.</p>

<p>Many weaver-birds in Asia and Africa hang their nests
from the ends of twigs and branches overhanging the
water. This is to keep away monkeys and snakes, which
abound in hot countries and are the greatest enemies birds
have. The wise little weaver knows that the cunning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
monkey will not trust his precious life to a frail branch
that may break, and drop him into the water; yet the
same frail branch is strong enough for the bird and its
nest. In this case, the monkey is obliged to admit that
the bird’s wisdom is more than a match for his.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/p124.jpg" width="400" height="350" alt="Weaver-birds and their nest" />
</div>

<p>A very curious custom exists among a class of birds
found in Africa, called “the social weavers.” They begin
their work in companies, and build immense canopies,
like umbrellas, in the tops of trees. These grassy structures
are so closely woven that the rain cannot penetrate
them. Under this shelter the birds build their nests, but
no longer in company; the nest for each pair must be
made by the pair without assistance from their neighbors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>The tailor-bird of India makes a still more curious nest
than that of the weavers: it actually sews, using its long,
slender bill as a needle. Birds that fly, birds that run,
birds that swim, and birds that sing are by no means rare;
but birds that sew seem like the wonderful birds in the
fairy-tales.</p>

<p>Yet they really exist, and make their odd nests with
great care and skill. They pick out a leaf large enough
for their nest, and pierce rows of holes along the edges
with their sharp bill; then, with the fibres of a plant or
long threads of grass, they sew the leaf up into a bag.
Sometimes it is necessary to sew two leaves together, that
the space within may be large enough.</p>

<p>This kind of sewing resembles shoemakers’ or saddlers’
work; but, the leaf being like fine cloth and not like
leather, perhaps the name “tailor-bird” is the most appropriate
for the little worker. The bag is lined with soft,
downy material, and in this the tiny eggs are laid&mdash;tiny
indeed, for the tailor-bird is no larger than the humming-bird.
The weight of the little creature does not even
draw down the nest, and the leaf in which the eggs or
young birds are hidden looks like the other leaves on the
trees; so that there is nothing to attract the attention of
the forest robbers.</p>

<p>Another bird, called the Indian sparrow, makes her
nest of grass, woven like cloth and shaped like a bottle.
The neck of the bottle hangs downward, and the bird
enters from below. This structure, swinging from a high
tree, over a river, is safe from the visits of mischievous
animals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>If all the stories about this Indian sparrow are true, the
inside of its nest is strangely adorned. Fire-flies are
brought in by the bird and stuck to the walls with clay;
whether they are placed there to light up the little home,
or to dazzle the bats that infest the neighborhood, no one
seems to know. Perhaps the truth is that the fire-flies
are in the nest in imagination only. However that may
be, the Indian sparrow is a clever workman.</p>

<p>Can you wonder that birds and their nests have always
been a source of delight to the thoughtful enquirer?</p>

<h2><a name="XLIX_THE_WHISTLE" id="XLIX_THE_WHISTLE"></a>XLIX.&mdash;THE WHISTLE.</h2>

<p class="author">Benjamin Franklin.</p>

<p>When I was a child, seven years old, my friends, on a
holiday, filled my pockets with coppers. I went directly
toward a shop where they sold toys for children; and,
being charmed with the sound of a whistle that I met
by the way in the hands of another boy, I voluntarily
offered him all my money for it.</p>

<p>I then returned home, and went whistling all over
the house, much pleased with my whistle, but disturbing
all the family. My brothers, and sisters, and cousins,
understanding the bargain I had made, told me I had
given four times as much for it as it was worth.</p>

<p>This put me in mind of what good things I might have
bought with the rest of the money; and they laughed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span> at
me so much for my folly that I cried with vexation.</p>

<p>This, however, was afterward of use to me, the impression
continuing on my mind; so that often, when I was
tempted to buy some unnecessary thing, I said to myself,
“Don’t give too much for the whistle;” and so I saved
my money.</p>

<p>As I grew up, went into the world, and observed the
actions of men, I thought I met with many, very many,
who gave too much for their whistles.</p>

<p>When I saw any one too ambitious of the favor of the
great, wasting his time in attendance on public dinners,
sacrificing his repose, his liberty, his virtue, and perhaps
his friends, to retain it, I said to myself, “This man gives
too much for his whistle.”</p>

<p>When I saw another fond of popularity, constantly
employing himself in politics, neglecting his own affairs,
and ruining them by that neglect, “He pays, indeed,” said
I, “too much for his whistle.”</p>

<p>If I knew a miser, who gave up every kind of comfortable
living, all the pleasure of doing good to others, all
the esteem of his fellow-citizens, and the joys of benevolent
friendship, for the sake of accumulating wealth,
“Poor man,” said I, “you do indeed pay too much for
your whistle.”</p>

<p>When I met a man of pleasure, sacrificing the improvement
of his mind, or of his fortune, to mere bodily comfort,
“Mistaken man,” said I, “you are providing pain
for yourself, instead of pleasure: you give too much for
your whistle.”</p>

<p>If I saw one fond of fine clothes, fine furniture, fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
horses, all above his fortune, for which he contracted
debts, and ended his career in prison, “Alas!” said I, “he
has paid dear, very dear, for his whistle.”</p>

<p>In short, I believed that a great part of the miseries of
mankind were brought upon them by the false estimates
they had made of the value of things, and by their giving
too much for their whistles.</p>

<h2><a name="LII_THE_FLAX" id="LII_THE_FLAX"></a>LII.&mdash;THE FLAX.</h2>

<p class="author">Hans Christian Andersen.</p>

<p>The flax was in full bloom; it had pretty little blue
flowers as delicate as the wings of a moth, or even more
so. The sun shone, and the showers watered it; and
this was just as good for the flax as it is for little children
to be washed and then kissed by their mother. They
look much prettier for it, and so did the flax.</p>

<p>“People say that I look exceedingly well,” said the flax,
“and that I am so fine and long, that I shall make a
beautiful piece of linen. How fortunate I am! it makes
me so happy; it is such a pleasant thing to know that
something can be made of me. How the sunshine cheers
me, and how sweet and refreshing is the rain! my happiness
overpowers me; no one in the world can feel happier
than I do.”</p>

<p>One day some people came, who took hold of the flax
and pulled it up by the roots; this was painful. Then
it was laid in water as if they intended to drown it; and,
after that, placed near a fire as if it were to be roasted;
all this was very shocking.</p>

<p>“We cannot expect to be happy always,” said the flax;
“by experiencing evil as well as good we become wise.”
And certainly there was plenty of evil in store for the
flax. It was steeped, and roasted, and broken, and
combed; indeed, it scarcely knew what was done to it.</p>

<p>At last it was put on the spinning-wheel. “Whirr,
whirr,” went the wheel so quickly that the flax could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
collect its thoughts.</p>

<p>“Well, I have been very happy,” he thought in the
midst of his pain, “and must be contented with the past;”
and contented he remained till he was put on the loom,
and became a beautiful piece of white linen. All the flax,
even to the last stalk, was used in making this one piece.
“How wonderful it is that, after all I have suffered, I am
made something of at last; I am the luckiest person in
the world&mdash;so strong and fine; and how white, and what
a length! This is something different from being a mere
plant and bearing flowers. Then I had no attention, nor
any water unless it rained. Now I am watched and
taken care of. Every morning the maid turns me over,
and I have a shower-bath from the watering-pot every
evening. Yes, and the clergyman’s wife noticed me, and
said I was the best piece of linen in the whole parish. I
cannot be happier than I am now.”</p>

<p>After some time, the linen was taken into the house,
placed under the scissors, and cut and torn into pieces,
and then pricked with needles. This certainly was not
pleasant; but at last it was made into garments.</p>

<p>“See, now, then,” said the flax, “I have become something
of importance. This was my destiny; it is quite a
blessing. Now I shall be of some use in the world, as
every one ought to be; it is the only way to be happy.”</p>

<p>Years passed away; and at last the linen was so worn
it could scarcely hold together.</p>

<p>“It must end very soon,” said the pieces to each other.
“We would gladly have held together a little longer, but
it is useless to expect impossibilities.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>And at length they fell into rags and tatters, and
thought it was all over with them, for they were torn to
shreds, and steeped in water, and made into a pulp, and
dried, and they knew not what besides, till all at once
they found themselves beautiful white paper.</p>

<p>“Well, now, this is a surprise; a glorious surprise too,”
said the paper. “I am now finer than ever, and I shall
be written upon, and who can tell what fine things I may
have written upon me? This is wonderful luck!”</p>

<p>And sure enough, the most beautiful stories and poetry
were written upon it, and only once was there a blot,
which was very fortunate.</p>

<p>Then people heard the stories and poetry read, and it
made them wiser and better; for all that was written
had a good and sensible meaning, and a great blessing
was contained in the words on the paper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>“I never imagined anything like this,” said the paper,
“when I was only a little blue flower, growing in the
fields. How could I fancy that I should ever be the
means of bringing knowledge and joy to men? I cannot
understand it myself, and yet it is really so. Heaven
knows that I have done nothing myself, but what I was
obliged to do with my weak powers for my own preservation;
and yet I have been promoted from one joy and
honor to another. Each time I think that the song is
ended; and then something higher and better begins for
me. I suppose now I shall be sent on my travels about
the world, so that people may read me. It cannot be
otherwise; indeed it is more than probable; for I have
more splendid thoughts written upon me than I had
pretty flowers in olden times. I am happier than ever.”</p>

<p>But the paper did not go on its travels. It was sent
to the printer, and all the words written upon it were set
up in type, to make a book, or rather hundreds of books;
for so many more persons could derive pleasure and profit
from a printed book than from the written paper; and if
the paper had been sent about the world, it would have
been worn out before it had got half through its journey.</p>

<p>“This is certainly the wisest plan,” said the written
paper; “I really did not think of that. I shall remain
at home and be held in honor, like some old grandfather,
as I really am to all these new books. They will
do some good. I could not have wandered about as they
do. Yet he who wrote all this has looked at me as every
word flowed from his pen upon my surface. I am the
most honored of all.”</p>

<p>Then the paper was tied in a bundle with other papers,
and thrown into a tub that stood in the washhouse.</p>

<p>“After work, it is well to rest,” said the paper, “and
a very good opportunity this is to collect one’s thoughts.
Now I am able, for the first time, to think of my real
condition; and to know one’s self is true progress. What
will be done with me now I wonder? No doubt I shall
still go forward.”</p>

<p>Now it happened one day that all the paper in the tub
was taken out, and laid on the hearth to be burnt.
People said it could not be sold at the shop, to wrap up
butter and sugar, because it had been written upon. The
children in the house stood round the stove; for they
wanted to see the paper burn, because it flamed up so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
prettily, and afterwards, among the ashes, so many red
sparks could be seen running one after the other, here
and there, as quick as the wind. They called it “seeing
the children come out of school,” and the last spark was
the schoolmaster. They often thought the last spark
had come; and one would cry, “There goes the schoolmaster;”
but the next moment another spark would
appear, shining so beautifully. How they would like to
know where the sparks all went to! Perhaps we shall
find out some day, but we don’t know now.</p>

<p>The whole bundle of paper had been placed on the fire,
and was soon alight. “Ugh!” cried the paper, as it
burst into a bright flame; “ugh!” It was certainly not
very pleasant to be burning; but when the whole was
wrapped in flames, the flames mounted up into the air,
higher than the flax had ever been able to raise its little
blue flower; and they glistened as the white linen never
could have glistened. All the written letters became
quite red in a moment, and all the words and thoughts
turned into fire.</p>

<p>“Now I am mounting straight up to the sun,” said a
voice in the flames; and it was as if a thousand voices
echoed the words; and the flames darted up through the
chimney, and went out at the top. Then a number of
tiny beings, as many in number as the flowers on the flax
had been, and invisible to mortal eyes, floated above them.
They were even lighter and more delicate than the flowers
from which they were born; and as the flames were
extinguished, and nothing remained of the paper but
black ashes, these little things danced upon it; and whenever
they touched it, bright red sparks appeared.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 331px;">
<img src="images/p143.jpg" width="331" height="400" alt="Egyptian ruins, and a pyramid" />
</div>

<p>Egypt embraces that part of Africa occupied by the
valley of the River Nile. For many centuries, it was a
thickly populated country, and at one time possessed
great influence and wealth, and had reached an advanced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
state of civilization.</p>

<p>The history of Egypt extends through a period of
about six thousand years. During this time great cities
were built, which flourished for hundreds of years. Owing
to wars and changes of government, many of these cities
were destroyed, and nothing of them now remains but
massive and extensive ruins. Pyramids were built, obelisks
erected, canals projected, and many other vast enterprises
were carried out. Remains of these are to be
seen to-day, some in ruins, some fairly preserved, and,
altogether, they give the present generation an idea of
the wealth and power of the different dynasties under
which they were built.</p>

<p>Not far from Cairo, which is now the principal city of
Egypt, stand the famous pyramids. These are of such
immense proportions, that from a distance their tops
seem to reach the clouds. They are constructed of great
blocks of stone. Some of these are of great size, and how
the builders put them into their places, is a question we
cannot answer.</p>

<p>It is supposed that the construction of the largest
pyramid required the labor of thousands of men, for more
than twenty years. It is four hundred and sixty-one feet
high, seven hundred and forty-six feet long at the base,
and covers more than twelve acres of ground.</p>

<p>Sixty-seven of these pyramids in all have been discovered
and explored. They are the tombs in which the
kings of ancient Egypt and their families were buried.
To contain their coffins, which were made of stone, many
chambers were constructed in the interior of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span> pyramids.
It has been calculated that one of the principal
pyramids could contain three thousand seven hundred
rooms of large size.</p>

<p>The bodies of those who were buried in the pyramids
were preserved from decay by a secret process, which we
call embalming, and which was known only to the priests.
After the bodies were embalmed, they were wrapped in
bands of fine linen, and on the inside of these was spread a
peculiar kind of gum. Sometimes as many as a thousand
yards of these bands were wrapped around a single body.
After the bandaged body was thus prepared, a soft substance
was placed around it. When this covering hardened,
it kept the body in a state of complete preservation.
These coverings are now called mummy-cases, and the
bodies they enclose are called mummies. The bodies were
finally placed in huge stone coffins, many of which were
covered with curious carvings.</p>

<p>Some mummies have been found, that are said to be
over three thousand years old. But, notwithstanding this
great age, when the wrappings are removed from them,
many of the bodies have been so well preserved, that the
features present the appearance which they had in life.
Large numbers of mummies have been carried off to other
countries and placed on exhibition in museums.</p>

<p>The ancient Egyptians erected many obelisks in various
parts of their country. These were monuments made
from single pieces of hard stone, and in some cases they
reached a height of more than a hundred feet. They
were placed before gateways leading to the principal
temples and palaces, and were covered with curious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
carvings, which represented the language of the people
at that time. Their written language was not composed
of letters and words like our own; but they used pictures
of animals, including birds, and also pictures of human
figures, and other devices of a similar nature, to express
their thoughts and ideas. These pictures are now called
hieroglyphics.</p>

<p>Until the year 1799, scholars of modern nations were
unable to read this strange language. In that year,
however, a stone tablet was discovered by a French
engineer, containing an inscription written in three
different characters:&mdash;namely: first, in the hieroglyphics
spoken of above; second, in a running hand also used
by the Egyptians; and third, in the well known letters
of the Greek alphabet.</p>

<p>By comparing the words of these inscriptions with
many others, the proper method of interpreting this
peculiar language was ascertained. It was then learned
that the inscriptions on these obelisks were the records
of memorable events, and of the heroic deeds of ancient
kings and heroes.</p>

<p>Many of the obelisks have been taken from their
positions in Egypt and transported with great labor to
other countries. Nearly two thousand years ago, the
Roman Emperors began to carry them to Rome, where
they were set up in the public squares. Altogether, nearly
fifty of these remarkable monuments were taken away
and set up in that city. They were then, and are still,
regarded as evidences of the wonderful ingenuity and
skill of the ancients who first made them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>In late years, obelisks have been taken to Paris and
London, and more recently one has been brought to
America, and set up in Central Park in New York City.
This one belongs to the largest class, being nearly seventy
feet high and about eight feet square at the base.</p>

<p>In their large cities, the Egyptians built massive temples
which were dedicated to religious ceremonies. Some
of them, although now in ruins, are considered to be
among the most remarkable productions of the ancients.
Tourists who nowadays sail up the River Nile and visit
the site of the city of Thebes, the ancient capital of
Egypt, are struck with amazement at the vast ruins
surrounding them.</p>

<p>On the eastern side of the Nile lies what is left of the
temple of Karnak. Imagine a long line of courts, gateways,
and halls; with here and there an obelisk rising
above the ruins, and shutting off the view of the forest
of columns! The temple is approached on every side by
avenues and gateways of colossal grandeur. It originally
covered an area of two hundred and seventy acres, enclosed
within a wall of brick, parts of which are still
visible, while the rest lie crumbled and broken.</p>

<p>It is difficult to realize the grand appearance of the
thirty rows of stone columns standing within the wall.
Some of those that are still perfect, are capped with
enormous monolith capitals, and it is said that on one of
them a hundred men could stand without crowding.</p>

<p>The hall itself is four hundred and twenty-two feet
long by one hundred and sixty-five feet broad. The
stones of the ceiling are supported by one hundred and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
thirty-four columns. The largest measures ten feet in
diameter, and more than seventy-two feet in height.
They are covered with carvings and paintings whose
colors are still bright, even after a lapse of forty centuries.</p>

<p>Gazing on what he sees around him, the traveller becomes
lost in the effort to form some idea of the grandeur
and vastness of the original.</p>

On the top of this mountain the victorious English troops, who had

<h2><a name="LVII_THE_RUBY-THROATED_HUMMING-BIRD" id="LVII_THE_RUBY-THROATED_HUMMING-BIRD"></a>LVII.&mdash;THE RUBY-THROATED HUMMING-BIRD.</h2>

<p class="author">Audubon.</p>

<p>The most common, as well as the most beautiful,
species of humming-birds, is the ruby-throat, a name given
to it on account of the delicate metallic feathers, which
glow with ruby lustre on its throat, gleaming in the sunshine
like gems of living fire. From the tip of the bill to
that of the tail, it measures about three and a half inches.
The upper part of the neck, the back, and the wing-coverts,
are of a resplendent and varied green and gold.
The breast and lower parts are white, the wings purplish
brown, and the tail partly of the same color, with the
two middle tail-feathers of vivid green.</p>

<p>In the warm climate of the Southern States, the beautiful
little ruby-throat is found throughout the winter; and
as the summer draws on, the heat in the Northern States
and Canada suiting its delicate constitution, it migrates
in large numbers, appearing in Canada towards the end
of June. The long flights of these tiny creatures are performed
at night, it is supposed, as they are found feeding
leisurely at all times of the day. When passing through
the air they move at a rapid rate, in long undulations,
now rising for some distance at an angle of about forty
degrees, then falling in a curve.</p>

<p>Small as they are, from their rapid flight and meteor-like
movements, they do not fear the largest birds of prey;
for even should the lordly eagle venture into their domains,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
the tiny creature will attack him without fear; and one
has been seen perched on the head of an eagle, at which
it was pecking away furiously, scattering the feathers of
the huge bird, who flew screaming through the air with
alarm, to rid himself of his tiny assailant.</p>

<p>Brave and high-spirited as is the little bird, it is easily
tamed; and Mr. Webber, the naturalist, succeeded in
securing several specimens. The first he caught did not
flutter, or make the least attempt to escape, but remained
quietly in his hand; and he saw, when he opened it, the
minute creature lying on his palm, perfectly motionless,
feigning most skilfully to be dead. As he watched it
with breathless curiosity, he saw it slowly open its bright
little eyes to see whether the way was clear, and then close
them slowly as it caught his glance upon it. When a
mixture of sugar, water, and honey, was brought, and a
drop placed on its bill, it came very suddenly to life, and
in a moment was on its legs, drinking with eager gusto
of the refreshing draught from a silver teaspoon.</p>

<p>The nest of the ruby-throat is of a most delicate nature,
the external parts being formed of bits of a little grey
lichen, found on the branches of trees, glued together by
the saliva of the bird. Bits of lichen are also neatly
arranged round the whole of the nest, and to some distance
from the spot where the nest is attached to the tree. The
interior is formed of a cottony substance, and is lined
with silky fibres obtained from various plants.</p>

<p>The difficulty of finding the little nests of the humming-birds
is increased by a curious habit possessed by some
of the species. When they leave or approach their home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>,
they do so as if conscious that by the bright gleam of
their plumage they may give an indication of the place
of their nest. Rising perpendicularly until they are out
of sight, and then flying to the point under which their
nest is placed, they drop down upon it as perpendicularly
as they ascended.</p>

<p>The eggs are only two in number, and although somewhat
larger than might be imagined from the size of the
bird, are very small indeed. They are of a delicate,
slightly pink, semi-transparent, white color, and have been
well compared to pearls.</p>

<p>Could you cast a momentary glance on the nest of a
humming-bird, and see, as I have seen, the newly hatched
pair of young, not much larger than humble-bees, naked,
blind, and so feeble as scarcely to be able to raise their
little bills to receive food from their parents, and could
you see those parents full of anxiety and fear, passing and
repassing within a few inches of your face, alighting on a
twig not more than a yard from you, and waiting the
result of your unwelcome visit in a state of despair&mdash;you
could not fail to be interested in such a display of parental
affection. Then how pleasing it is, on leaving the spot,
to see the returning joy of the parents, when, after
examining the nest, they find their nurslings untouched!</p>

<h2><a name="LXI_ANTS_AND_THEIR_SLAVES" id="LXI_ANTS_AND_THEIR_SLAVES"></a>LXI.&mdash;ANTS AND THEIR SLAVES.</h2>

<p class="author">Michelet.</p>

<p>Peter Huber, the son of the celebrated observer of the
manners and habits of bees, walking one day in a field near
Geneva, saw on the ground a strong detachment of reddish-colored
ants on the march, and bethought himself of following
them. On the flanks of the column, as if to dress
its ranks, a few sped to and fro in eager haste. After
marching for about a quarter of an hour, they halted
before an ant-hill belonging to some small black ants,
and a desperate struggle took place at its gates.</p>

<p>A small number of blacks offered a brave resistance; but
the great majority of the people thus assailed fled through
the gates remotest from the scene of combat, carrying
away their young. It was just these which were the
cause of the strife, what the blacks most feared being
the theft of their offspring. And soon the assailants, who
had succeeded in penetrating into the city, might be seen
emerging from it, loaded with the young black progeny.</p>

<p>The red ants, encumbered with their living booty, left
the unfortunate city in the desolation of its great loss, and
resumed the road to their own habitation, whither their
astonished and almost breathless observer followed them.
But how was his astonishment augmented when, at the
threshold of the red ants’ community, a small population
of black ants came forward to receive the plunder, welcoming
with visible joy these children of their own race,
which would perpetuate it in the foreign lands!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>This, then, is a mixed city, where the strong warrior-ants
live on a perfectly good understanding with the little
blacks. But what of the latter? Huber speedily discovered
that, in fact, they do everything. They alone build;
they alone bring up the young red ants and the captives
of their own species; they alone administer the affairs of
the community, provide its supplies of food, and wait upon
and feed their red masters, who, like great infant giants,
indolently allow their little attendants to feed them at
the mouth. No other occupations are theirs but war,
theft, and kidnapping. No other movements in the intervals
than to wander about lazily, and bask in the sunshine
at the doors of their barracks.</p>

<p>Huber made an experiment. He was desirous of
observing what would be the result if the great red ants
found themselves without servants,&mdash;whether they would
know how to supply their own wants. He put a few into
a glass case, and put some honey for them in a corner, so
that they had nothing to do but to take it. Miserable the
degradation, cruel the punishment with which slavery
afflicts the enslavers! They did not touch it; they seemed
to know nothing; they had become so grossly ignorant
that they could no longer feed themselves. Some of them
died from starvation, with food before them!</p>

<p>Huber, to complete the experiment, then introduced
into the case one black ant. The presence of this
sagacious slave changed the face of things, and re-established
life and order. He went straight to the honey, and
fed the great dying simpletons.</p>

<p>The little blacks in many things carry a moral authority<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
whose signs are very visible. They do not, for example,
permit the great red ants to go out alone on useless expeditions,
but compel them to return into the city. Nor are
they even at liberty to go out in a body, if their wise little
slaves do not think the weather favorable, if they fear a
storm, or if the day is far advanced. When an excursion
proves unsuccessful, and they return without children, the
little blacks are stationed at the gates of the city to forbid
their ingress, and send them back to the combat; nay
more, you may see them take the cowards by the collar,
and force them to retrace their route.</p>

<p>These are astounding facts; but they were seen, as here
described, by our illustrious observer. Not being able to
trust his eyes, he summoned one of the greatest naturalists
of Sweden, Jurine, to his side, to make new investigations,
and decide whether he had been deceived. This witness,
and others who afterwards pursued the same course of
experiments, found that his discoveries were entirely
accurate. Yet after all these weighty testimonies, I still
doubted. But on a certain occasion I saw it&mdash;with my
own eyes saw it&mdash;in the park of Fontainebleau. I was
accompanied by an illustrious philosopher, an excellent
observer, and he too saw exactly what I saw.</p>

<p>It was half-past four in the afternoon of a very warm
day. From a pile of stones emerged a column of from
four to five hundred red or reddish ants. They marched
rapidly towards a piece of turf, kept in order by their
sergeants or “pivot-men,” whom we saw on the flanks,
and who would not permit any one to straggle. (This is
a circumstance known to everyone who has seen a file of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
ants on the march.)</p>

<p>Suddenly the mass seemed to sink and disappear.
There was no sign of ant-hills in the turf; but after a
while we detected an almost imperceptible orifice, through
which we saw them vanish in less time than it takes me
to write these words. We asked ourselves if it was an
entrance to their domicile; if they had re-entered their
city. In a minute at the utmost they gave us a reply,
and showed us our mistake. They issued in a throng,
each carrying a captive in its mandibles.</p>

<p>From the short time they had taken, it was evident
that they had a previous knowledge of the locality, the
place where the eggs were deposited, the time when they
were to assemble, and the degree of resistance they had to
expect. Perhaps it was not their first journey. The little
blacks on whom the red ants made this raid sallied out in
considerable numbers; and I truly pitied them. They did
not attempt to fight. They seemed frightened and
stunned. They endeavored only to delay the red ants
by clinging to them. A red ant was thus stopped; but
another red one, who was free, relieved him of his burden,
and thereupon the black ant relaxed his grasp.</p>

<p>It was, in fact, a pitiful sight. The blacks offered no
serious resistance. The five hundred ants succeeded in
carrying off nearly three hundred children. At two or
three feet from the hole, the blacks ceased to pursue them,
and resigned themselves to their fate. All this did not
occupy ten minutes between the departure and the return.
The two parties were very unequal. It was very probably
an outrage often repeated&mdash;a tyranny of the great, who
levied a tribute of children from their poor little neighbors.</p>

<h2><a name="LXIII_THE_CAPTURE_OF_A_WHALE" id="LXIII_THE_CAPTURE_OF_A_WHALE"></a>LXIII.&mdash;THE CAPTURE OF A WHALE.</h2>

<p class="author">Cooper.</p>

<p>“Tom,” cried Barnstable, starting, “there is the blow of
a whale!”</p>

<p>“Ay, ay, sir!” returned the cockswain with undisturbed
composure: “here is his spout, not half a mile to seaward.
The easterly gale has driven the creature to leeward;
and he begins to find himself in shoal water. He’s
been sleeping while he should have been working to
windward.”</p>

<p>“The fellow takes it coolly, too. He’s in no hurry to
get an offing.”</p>

<p>“I rather conclude, sir,” said the cockswain, rolling over
his tobacco in his mouth very composedly, while his little
sunken eyes began to twinkle with pleasure at the sight,
“the gentleman has lost his reckoning, and doesn’t know
which way to head to take himself back into blue water.”</p>

<p>“’Tis a fin-back!” exclaimed the lieutenant. “He will
soon make headway, and be off.”</p>

<p>“No, sir, ’tis a right whale,” answered Tom; “I saw
his spout. He threw up a pair of as pretty rainbows as
one could wish to see. He’s a real oil-butt, that fellow!”</p>

<p>Barnstable laughed, and exclaimed in joyous tones,&mdash;“Give
strong way, my hearties! There seems nothing
better to be done; let us have a stroke of a harpoon at
that impudent rascal.” The men shouted spontaneously;
and the old cockswain suffered his solemn visage to relax
into a small laugh, while the whale-boat sprang forward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
like a courser for the goal.</p>

<p>During the few minutes they were pulling toward
their game, Long Tom arose from his crouching attitude
in the stern-sheets, and transferred his huge frame to the
bows of the boat, where he made such preparations to
strike the whale as the occasion required. The tub, containing
about half a whale line, was placed at the feet of
Barnstable, who had been preparing an oar to steer with
in place of the rudder which was unshipped, in order that,
if necessary, the boat might be whirled round when not
advancing.</p>

<p>Their approach was utterly unnoticed by the monster
of the deep, who continued to amuse himself with throwing
the water in two circular spouts high into the air;
occasionally flourishing the broad flukes of his tail with
graceful but terrific force until the hardy seamen were
within a few hundred feet of him, when he suddenly cast
his head downward, and without apparent effort, reared
his immense body for many feet above the water, waving
his tail violently, and producing a whizzing noise that
sounded like the rushing of winds.</p>

<p>The cockswain stood erect, poising his harpoon, ready
for the blow; but, when he beheld the creature assuming
this formidable attitude, he waved his hand to his commander,
who instantly signed to his men to cease rowing.
In this situation the sportsman rested a few minutes;
while the whale struck several blows on the water in rapid
succession, the noise of which re-echoed along the cliffs
like the hollow reports of so many cannon. After this
wanton exhibition of his terrible strength, the monster<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
sank again into his native element and slowly disappeared.</p>

<p>“Which way did he head, Tom?” cried Barnstable, the
moment the whale was out of sight.</p>

<p>“Pretty much up and down, sir,” returned the cockswain,
his eye brightening with the excitement of the
sport. “He’ll soon run his nose against the bottom if he
stands long on that course, and will be glad to get another
snuff of pure air. Send her a few fathoms to starboard,
sir, and I promise we shall not be out of his track.”</p>

<p>The conjecture of the experienced old seaman proved
true; for in a few minutes the water broke near them,
and another spout was cast into the air, when the huge
animal rushed for half his length in the same direction,
and fell on the sea with a turbulence and foam equal to
that which is produced by the launching of a vessel for
the first time into its proper element. After this evolution,
the whale rolled heavily, and seemed to rest from
further efforts.</p>

<p>His slightest movements were closely watched by
Barnstable and his cockswain; and when he was in a state
of comparative rest, the former gave the signal to his crew
to ply their oars once more. A few long and vigorous
strokes sent the boat directly up to the broadside of the
whale, with its bows pointing towards one of the fins,
which was at times, as the animal yielded sluggishly to
the action of the waves, exposed to view. The cockswain
poised his harpoon with much precision, and then darted
it from him with a violence that buried the iron in the
body of their foe. The instant the blow was made, Long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
Tom shouted with singular earnestness:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Starn, all!”</p>

<p>“Stern, all!” echoed Barnstable; when the obedient
seamen, by united efforts, forced the boat in a backward
direction, beyond the reach of any blow from their
formidable antagonist. The alarmed animal, however,
meditated no such resistance. Ignorant of his own
power, and of the insignificance of his enemies, he sought
refuge in flight. One moment of stupid surprise succeeded
the entrance of the iron; then casting his huge tail into
the air with a violence that threw the sea around him
into increased commotion, he disappeared with the quickness
of lightning amid a cloud of foam.</p>

<p>“Snub him!” shouted Barnstable. “Hold on, Tom! he
rises already.”</p>

<p>“Ay, ay, sir!” replied the composed cockswain, seizing
the line, which was running out of the boat with a velocity
that rendered such a manœuvre rather hazardous, and
causing it to yield more gradually round the large loggerhead
that was placed in the bows of the boat for that
purpose. Presently the line stretched forward; and,
rising to the surface with tremulous vibrations, it indicated
the direction in which the animal might be expected to
reappear. Barnstable had cast the bows of the boat
towards that point before the terrified and wounded
victim rose to the surface. His time was, however, no
longer wasted in his sports, but as he ploughed his way
along the surface he forced the waters aside with prodigious
energy. The boat was dragged violently in his
wake, and it cut through the billows with a terrific
rapidity, that at moments appeared to bury it in the ocean.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>When Long Tom beheld his victim throwing his spouts
on high again, he pointed with exultation to the jetting
fluid, which was streaked with the deep red of blood, and
cried,&mdash;“Ay, I’ve touched the fellow’s life! It must be
more than two foot of blubber that stops my iron from
reaching the life of any whale that ever sculled the ocean.”</p>

<p>“I believe you have saved yourself the trouble of using
the bayonet you have rigged for a lance,” said his commander,
who entered into the sport with all the ardor of
one whose youth had been chiefly passed in such pursuits.
“Feel your line, Master Coffin: can we haul alongside of
our enemy? I like not the course he is steering, as he
tows us from the schooner.”</p>

<p>“’Tis the creatur’s way, sir,” said the cockswain.
“You know they need the air in their nostrils when they
run, the same as a man. But lay hold, boys, and let us
haul up to him.”</p>

<p>The seamen now seized their whale-line, and slowly
drew their boat to within a few feet of the tail of the fish,
whose progress became sensibly less rapid as he grew weak
with the loss of blood. In a few minutes he stopped
running, and appeared to roll uneasily on the water, as if
suffering the agony of death.</p>

<p>“Shall we pull in and finish him, Tom?” cried Barnstable.
“A few sets from your bayonet would do it.”</p>

<p>The cockswain stood examining his game with cool discretion,
and replied to this interrogatory,&mdash;</p>

<p>“No, sir! no! He’s going into his flurry; there’s no
occasion for using a soldier’s weapon in taking a whale.
Starn off, sir! starn off! the creatur’s in his flurry.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>The warning of the prudent cockswain was promptly
obeyed; and the boat cautiously drew off to a distance,
leaving to the animal a clear space while under its dying
agonies. From a state of perfect rest, the terrible monster
threw its tail on high as when in sport; but its blows
were trebled in rapidity and violence, till all was hid from
view by a pyramid of foam that was deeply dyed with
blood. The roarings of the fish were like the bellowings
of a herd of bulls, and it seemed as if a thousand monsters
were engaged in deadly combat behind the bloody
mist that obstructed the view.</p>

<p>Gradually these efforts subsided; and, when the discolored
water again settled down to the long and regular
swell of the ocean, the fish was seen exhausted, and
yielding passively to its fate. As life departed, the
enormous black mass rolled to one side; and when the
white and glistening skin of the belly became apparent,
the seamen well knew that their victory was achieved.</p>

<h2><a name="LXV_THE_MONSTER_OF_THE_NILE" id="LXV_THE_MONSTER_OF_THE_NILE"></a>LXV.&mdash;THE MONSTER OF THE NILE.</h2>

<p class="author">Sir Samuel Baker.</p>

<p>Few creatures are so sly and wary as the crocodile. I
watch them continually as they attack the dense flocks of
small birds that throng the bushes at the water’s edge.
These birds are perfectly aware of the danger, and they fly
from the attack, if possible. The crocodile then quietly
and innocently lies upon the surface, as though it had appeared
quite by an accident. It thus attracts the attention
of the birds, and it slowly sails away to a considerable
distance, exposed to their view. The birds, thus beguiled
by the deceiver, believe that the danger is removed, and
they again flock to the bush<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>, and once more dip their
thirsty beaks in the stream.</p>

<p>Thus absorbed in slaking their thirst, they do not
observe that their enemy is no longer on the surface. A
sudden splash, followed by a huge pair of jaws, beneath
the bush, which engulf some dozens of victims, is the signal
unexpectedly given of the crocodile’s return&mdash;he having
slily dived, and hastened under cover of water to his
victims. I have seen the crocodile repeat this manœuvre
constantly: they deceive by a feigned retreat, and then
attack from below.</p>

<p>In like manner the crocodile perceives, while it is
floating on the surface in mid-stream, or from the opposite
side of the river, a woman filling her girba, or an animal
drinking. Sinking immediately, it swims perhaps a hundred
yards nearer, and again appearing for an instant upon
the surface, it assures itself of the position of its prey by a
steady look. Once more it sinks, and reaches the exact
spot above which the person or animal may be. Seeing
distinctly through the water, it generally makes its fatal
rush from beneath,&mdash;sometimes seizing with its jaws, and
at other times striking the object into the water with its
tail, after which it seizes it, and carries it off.</p>

<p>The crocodile does not attempt to swallow a large prey
at once, but generally carries it away, and keeps it for a
considerable time in its jaws in some deep hole beneath a
rock or the root of a tree, where it eats it at leisure. The
tongue of the crocodile is so unlike that of any other
creature that it can hardly be called by the same name.
No portion of it is detached from the flesh of the lower
jaw; it is like a thickened membrane extending from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
the gullet to about half-way along the length of jaw.</p>

<p>I was one day returning from head-quarters to my
station&mdash;a distance of a mile and a half along the river’s
bank&mdash;when I noticed the large head of a crocodile about
thirty yards from the shore. I knew every inch of the
river, and I was satisfied that the water was shallow. A
solitary piece of waving rush, that grew upon the bank
exactly opposite the crocodile, marked its position. So,
stooping down, I retreated inland from the bank, and
then running forward, I crept gently towards the rush.</p>

<p>Stooping as low as possible, I advanced till very near the
bank (upon which grew tufts of grass), when, by slowly
raising my head, I could observe the head of the crocodile
in the same position, not more than twenty-six or twenty-eight
yards from me. At that distance my rifle could hit
a half-crown; I therefore made sure of bagging. The bank
was about four feet above the water; thus the angle was
favorable, and I aimed just behind the eye. Almost as I
touched the trigger, the crocodile gave a convulsive start,
and turning slowly on its back, it stretched its four legs
above the surface, straining every muscle. It then
remained motionless in water about two feet deep.</p>

<p>My horse was always furnished with a long halter or
tethering-rope. So I ordered two men to jump into the
river and secure the crocodile by a rope fastened round
the body behind the fore-legs. This was quickly accomplished,
and the men remained knee-deep, hauling upon the
rope to prevent the stream from carrying away the body.
In the meantime an attendant had mounted my horse and
galloped off to the camp for assistance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>Crocodiles are very tenacious of life; and although
they may be shot through the brain, and be actually dead
for all practical purposes, they will remain motionless at
first; but they will begin instinctively to move the limbs
and tail a few minutes after receiving the shot. If lying
upon a sand-bank, or in deep water, they would generally
disappear unless secured by a rope, as the spasmodic
movements of the limbs and tail would act upon the water,
and the body would be carried away.</p>

<p>The crocodile, which had appeared stone dead, now
began to move its tail, and my two men who were holding
on to the rope cried out that it was still alive. It was in
vain that I assured the frightened fellows that it was dead.
I was on the bank, and they were in the water within a
few feet of the crocodile, which made some difference in
our ideas of its vivacity. Presently the creature really
began to struggle, and the united efforts of the men could
hardly restrain it from getting into deeper water.</p>

<p>The monster now began to yawn, which so terrified the
men that they would have dropped the rope and fled had
they not been afraid of the consequences, as I was
addressing them rather forcibly from the bank. I put
another shot through the shoulder of the struggling
monster, which appeared to act as a narcotic until the
arrival of the soldiers with ropes. No sooner was the
crocodile well secured than it began to struggle violently.
But a great number of men hauled upon the rope; and
when it was safely landed, I gave it a blow with a sharp
ax on the back of the neck, which killed it by dividing
the spine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>It was now dragged along the turf until we reached the
camp, where it was carefully measured with a tape, and
showed an exact length of twelve feet three inches from
snout to end of tail. The stomach contained about five
pounds’ weight of pebbles, as though it had fed upon flesh
resting upon a gravel bank, and had swallowed the pebbles
that had adhered. Mixed with the pebbles was a greenish
slimy matter that appeared woolly.</p>

<p>In the midst of this were three undeniable witnesses
that convicted the crocodile of wilful murder. A necklace
and two armlets, such as are worn by the negro girls, were
taken from the stomach! This was an old malefactor
that was a good riddance.</p>

<p>I have frequently seen crocodiles upwards of eighteen
feet in length, and there can be little doubt that they
sometimes exceed twenty; but a very small creature of
this species may carry away a man while swimming.</p>

<h2><a name="LXVII_THE_THERMOMETER" id="LXVII_THE_THERMOMETER"></a>LXVII.&mdash;THE THERMOMETER.</h2>

<p>All substances produce in us, when we touch them, the
sensation of heat or of cold. The degree of heat of any
substance is called its temperature; and the temperature
varies from time to time, according to circumstances.
Boiling water, for example, contains so much heat that
it scalds the skin; but, when removed from the fire, the
water gradually becomes less and less warm, until at last
it contains so little heat that it cools the hand instead of
scalding it.</p>

<p>Our feelings do not always give us true information
about the temperature of the bodies by which we are
surrounded. A person comes into a warm room from the
open air on a cold day, and exclaims, “How warm it is
here!” Another person enters the same room from one
still warmer, and cries, “How cold it is here!” The
first person gains heat, and therefore calls the room
warm; the second loses heat, and calls it cold; while, in
reality, the air of the room, all the while, is at the same
degree of temperature.</p>

<p>A nurse prepares water for a child’s bath, and measures
the heat by the feeling of her hand; but she learns from
the quick and sudden cry of the child, when placed in the
bath, that what seemed warm to her is cold to the child.</p>

<p>These examples show that our sensations are not always
a true test of temperature; and thus, if we wish to
measure heat and cold accurately, we must have some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
instrument made for the purpose. Such an instrument
we have: it is called a thermometer, a word which means
heat-measurer.</p>

<p>It was long ago noticed that bodies expand, or swell
out, when they are heated; and that they contract, or
shrink into less bulk, when they are cooled. This observation
led to the construction of the thermometer; for to
measure the expansion or contraction of a substance is
the same as to measure the quantity of heat that has
produced this effect.</p>

<p>The thermometer consists of a small glass tube of very
fine bore and ending in a hollow bulb. The bulb is
entirely filled with a fluid metal, called mercury, or
quicksilver, which rises or falls in the tube according as
it is heated or cooled. The space in the tube above the
mercury is empty: it does not even contain air; for in
preparing the instrument, sufficient heat is applied to the
bulb to make the fluid, by expansion, fill the whole tube,
which is then closely sealed at the upper end by melting
the glass: the mercury sinks as it cools, and leaves the
space empty.</p>

<p>The tube is fastened to a metal or wooden plate, marked
so as to measure the expansion of the mercury. This is
called the scale, and the divisions upon it are called
degrees. The degrees are counted upwards from the
bottom, and are expressed by placing a small circle over
the number. There are three different scales in use;
that commonly used in this country is called Fahrenheit’s
scale, from the name of the inventor.</p>

<p>When the tube of the thermometer is immersed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
melting ice or freezing water, the upper surface of the
mercury stands always at the same point, which is called
the <i>freezing point of water</i>. On Fahrenheit’s thermometer
this point is marked 32°. Again, when the bulb is held
in the steam of boiling water, the mercury rises to a fixed
point, which is called the <i>boiling point of water</i>, and is
marked 212°. All bodies that are as hot as boiling water,
raise the mercury to 212°; and all bodies that are as cold
as freezing water, make the mercury shrink to 32°. The
space between these two points is divided into 180
equal parts, each being called a degree. Similar equal
divisions are carried below the point marked 32°, till 0°
is reached, and this last point is called <i>zero</i>.</p>

<p>The tube of the thermometer may contain some other
fluid than mercury; but, as this metal is in every respect
well fitted for the purpose, it is most generally used in
construction of the instrument.</p>

<p>The thermometer is one of the most useful inventions
of science. It enables travellers to compare the climates
of different countries, and to give us, who stay at home,
a distinct idea of them. It is also necessary in the arts:
it enables workmen to apply the exact amount of heat
required in delicate operations, where a little excess might
spoil the whole work.</p>

<h2><a name="LXVIII_GOLDEN_DEEDS" id="LXVIII_GOLDEN_DEEDS"></a>LXVIII.&mdash;GOLDEN DEEDS.</h2>

<p>What is a golden deed? It is something which we do
for the good of others when we think more of them than
we do of ourselves. And it is called <i>golden</i>, because the
rarest and most precious things in all the world are the
acts of unselfish men.</p>

<p>Let me tell you the story of a golden deed that was
performed by Sir Philip Sidney. This brave English
knight was fighting in the Netherlands, to help the Dutch
in their struggle for liberty against the tyrant, Philip of
Spain. In a fierce battle he was struck by a musket ball,
which broke his thigh-bone. Thirsty and faint from loss
of blood, he called for water.</p>

<p>He had just raised the cup to his lips, when his eye fell
on a poor, dying soldier, who was looking longingly at the
cool drink. Without so much as tasting it, Sidney handed
the cup to the poor fellow with these words: “<i>Thy
necessity is greater than mine.</i>”</p>

<p>Here is the story of another golden deed. A little boy,
named Peter, who lived in Holland a long time ago,
was once on his way home late in the evening, when
he became alarmed at hearing water trickling through
a sluice or gate in one of the many dikes which are so
necessary for the safety of that country; for you must
know that Holland is so flat and low that it is in constant
danger of finding itself under water.</p>

<p>He stopped and thought of what would happen if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
hole were not closed. He had often heard his father tell
of the sad disasters which had come from such small
beginnings as this&mdash;how, in a few hours, the little aperture
gradually enlarged until the whole defence was
washed away, and the rolling, dashing, angry sea rushed
in, and swept on to the next village, destroying life and
property. Should he run home and alarm the villagers,
it would be dark before they could arrive; and the hole,
even then, might become so large as to defy all attempts
to close. What could he do to prevent such a terrible
ruin&mdash;he, only a little boy? He sat down on the bank
of the canal, stopped the opening with his hand, and
patiently awaited the passing of a villager. But no one
came. Hour after hour rolled by, yet there sat the
heroic boy, in cold and darkness, shivering, wet, and
tired, but stoutly pressing his hand against the water
that was trying to pass the dangerous breach. The
remainder of the story is thus told by an American poet,
Miss Phœbe Cary:&mdash;</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Now let us hear of a golden deed done more than two
thousand years ago&mdash;a deed that has made the names of
Damon and Pythias famous for ever.</p>

<p>In Syracuse there was so hard a ruler that the people
made a plot to drive him out of the city. The plot was
discovered, and the king commanded that the leaders
should be put to death. One of these, named Damon,
lived at some distance from Syracuse. He asked that
before he was put to death, he might be allowed to go
home to say good-bye to his family, promising that he
would then come back to die, at the appointed time.</p>

<p>The king did not believe that he would keep his word,
and said, “I will not let you go unless you find some
friend who will come and stay in your place. Then, if
you are not back on the day set for execution, I shall put
your friend to death in your stead.” The king thought
to himself, “Surely no one will ever take the place of a
man condemned to death.”</p>

<p>Now, Damon had a very dear friend named Pythias,
who at once came forward and offered to stay in prison
while Damon was allowed to go away. The king was
very much surprised, but he had given his word; Damon
was therefore permitted to leave for home, while Pythias
was shut up in prison.</p>

<p>Many days passed,&mdash;the time for the execution was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
close at hand, and Damon had not come back. The king,
curious to see how Pythias would behave, now that death
seemed so near, went to the prison. “Your friend will
never return,” he said to Pythias.</p>

<p>“You are wrong,” was the answer. “Damon will be
here if he can possibly come. But he has to travel by sea,
and the winds have been blowing the wrong way for
several days. However, it is much better that I should
die than he. I have no wife and no children, and I love
my friend so well that it would be easier to die for him
than to live without him. So I am hoping and praying
that he may be delayed until my head has fallen.”</p>

<p>The king went away more puzzled than ever. The
fatal day arrived. Still Damon had not come, and Pythias
was brought forward and mounted the scaffold. “My
prayers are heard,” he cried. “I shall be permitted to
die for my friend. But mark my words. Damon is
faithful and true; you will yet have reason to know that
he has done his utmost to be here.”</p>

<p>Just at this moment a man came galloping up at full
speed, on a horse covered with foam! It was Damon.
In an instant he was on the scaffold, and had Pythias in
his arms. “My beloved friend,” he cried, “the gods be
praised that you are safe. What agony have I suffered in
the fear that my delay was putting your life in danger!”</p>

<p>There was no joy in the face of Pythias, for he did not
care to live if his friend must die. But the king had
heard all. At last he was forced to believe in the unselfish
friendship of these two. His hard heart melted at
the sight, and he set them both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span> free, asking only that
they would be his friends also.</p>

<h2><a name="LXX_AGE_OF_TREES" id="LXX_AGE_OF_TREES"></a>LXX.&mdash;AGE OF TREES.</h2>

<p>Man counts his life by years; the oak by centuries.
At one hundred years of age, the tree is but a sapling; at
five hundred, it is mature and strong; at six hundred, the
gigantic king of the greenwood begins to feel the touch
of Time; but the decline is as slow as the growth was,
and the sturdy old tree rears its proud head and reckons
centuries of old age just as it reckoned centuries of youth.</p>

<p>It has been said that the patriarch of the forest laughs
at history. Is it not true? Perhaps when the balmy
zephyrs stir the trees, the leaves whisper strange stories
to one another. The oaks, and the pines, and their brethren
of the wood, have seen so many suns rise and set, so
many seasons come and go, and so many generations pass
into silence, that we may well wonder what the “story of
the trees” would be to us, if they had tongues to tell it, or
we ears fine enough to understand.</p>

<p>“The king of white oak trees,” says a letter-writer in
the year 1883, “has been chopped down and taken to the
saw-mill. It was five hundred and twenty-five years old,
and made six twelve-foot logs, the first one being six feet
in diameter and weighing seven tons.” What a giant
that oak-tree must have been, and what changes in this
land of ours it must have witnessed! It looked upon the
forest when the red man ruled there alone; it was more
than a century old when Columbus landed in the New
World; and to that good age it added nearly four centuries
before the ax of the woodman laid it low.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet, venerable as this “king of white oak trees” was,
it was but an infant, compared
with other monarchs of the
Western solitudes. One California
pine, cut down about
1855, was, according to very
good authority, eleven hundred
and twenty years old;
and many of its neighbors in
its native grove are no less
ancient than it was. Who
shall presume, then, to fix the
age of the hoary trees that
still rear their stalwart frames
in the unexplored depths of
American wildernesses.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 315px;">
<img src="images/p189.jpg" width="315" height="500" alt="Tall trees" />
</div>

<p>In England there are still in
existence many trees that serve
to link the far-off past with
the living present. Some of
them were witnesses of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
fierce struggles between Norman
and Saxon when William the Conqueror planted his
standard&mdash;“the three bannered lions of Normandy old”&mdash;upon
English soil. Then there is the King’s Oak, at
Windsor, which, tradition informs us, was a great favorite
with William, when that bold Norman first enclosed the
forest for a royal hunting-ground.</p>

<p>The Conqueror loved to sit in the shade of the lofty,
spreading tree, and muse&mdash;upon what? Who knows what
fancies filled his brain, what feelings stirred his proud
spirit, what memories, what regrets, thrilled his heart, as
he sat there in the solitude? Over eight hundred years
have rolled away since the Norman usurper fought the
sturdy Saxon, and, for conqueror as for conquered, life,
and its ambitions, and its pangs, ended long ago; but the
mighty oak, whose greenness and beauty were a delight
to the Conqueror, still stands in Windsor Forest. Eight
centuries ago its royal master saw it a “goodly tree.”
How old is it now?</p>

<p>Older even than this, are the oaks near Croydon, nine
miles south of London. If the botanist may judge by the
usual evidences of age, these trees saw the glitter of the
Roman spears as the legions of the Empire wound their
way through the forest-paths or in the green open spaces
in the woodland. Now, the Roman legions left Britain
fourteen centuries ago, having been summoned home to
Rome because the Empire was in danger,&mdash;in fact, was
hastening to its fall. How wonderful, if fourteen centuries
have spared these oaks at Croydon!</p>

<p>There is a famous yew that must not go without notice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
in our record of ancient trees. This venerable tree stands
in its native field, ever green and enduring, as if the years
had forgotten it. Yet it was two centuries old when, in
the adjacent meadow, King John signed Magna Charta.
If we bear in mind that in 1215, the stout English barons
compelled their wicked king to sign the Great Charter,
protecting the rights of his subjects, we may conclude
that this patriarch-yew is at least eight hundred and fifty
years old.</p>

<p>The Parliament Oak&mdash;so called because it is said that
Edward I., who ruled England from 1272 to 1307, once
held a Parliament under its branches&mdash;is believed to be
fifteen hundred years old. If Fine-Ear, of the fairy-tale,
could come and translate for us the whispers of these
ancient English trees, and tell us ever so little of what
the stately monarchs of the wood have seen, what new
histories might be written, what old chronicles reversed!</p>

<p>On the mountains of Lebanon, a few of the cedars,
famous in sacred and in profane history, yet remain. One
of these relics of the past has been estimated to be three
thousand five hundred years old. The patriarchs of the
English forests cannot, then, so far as age is considered,
claim equal rank with the “cedars of Lebanon.” But the
baobab, or “monkey-bread,” of Senegal, must take the
first rank among long-lived trees. Even the “goodly
trees” of Lebanon must, if ordinary proofs can be trusted,
yield the palm to their African rival.</p>

<p>An eminent French botanist of the eighteenth century,
whose discoveries in natural history are of great interest
to the world of science, lived some years in Senegal, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
had ample opportunity to observe and study the wonderful
baobab. He saw several trees of this species growing,
and from the most careful calculations, he formed his
opinion as to the age of some of these African wonders.
One baobab, which even in its decay measured one hundred
and nine feet in circumference, he believed to be
more than five thousand years old. Truly, the patriarchs
of the forest laugh at history.</p>

<h2><a name="LXXII_HEAT_CONDUCTION_AND" id="LXXII_HEAT_CONDUCTION_AND"></a>LXXII.&mdash;HEAT:&mdash;CONDUCTION AND
RADIATION.</h2>

<p>In a former lesson you read a description of the thermometer,
a useful instrument which enables us to estimate
the temperature, or sensible heat, of substances.</p>

<p>All bodies, even the coldest, contain heat; and they
have also a tendency to part with their heat to colder
substances around them, until all have the same temperature.
Thus, when you lay your hand on a block of iron
or marble, heat leaves your hand to enter the less warm
material and raise its temperature; and it is this abstraction
of heat that produces in you the sensation of cold.</p>

<p>There is, then, a constant communication or transmission
of heat from one body to another. This communication
is effected chiefly in two ways&mdash;by <i>conduction</i> and
by <i>radiation</i>. In conduction, the bodies are in contact;
in radiation, they are at some distance apart.</p>

<p>If you push one end of a cold poker into the fire, that
end will soon become warm, and the heat will be propagated
from particle to particle through the poker, until
the end most distant from the fire becomes too hot to be
touched without injury. This mode of transmission is
called conduction. Different substances possess this
power in very different degrees. Thus, if instead of a
poker you thrust into the fire a bar of wood of equal
length and thickness, you will find that, even when the
inserted end is in flames, the other remains comparatively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
cold, and may be handled with impunity. Hence we say
that iron is a <i>good</i> conductor, and wood a <i>bad</i> conductor
of heat.</p>

<p>The conducting power of bodies depends in a great
measure on the closeness of their particles&mdash;dense, solid
substances being much better conductors than those
which are light and porous. The metals are the best
conductors, but they differ very much among themselves.
The best is silver; the others stand in this respect in the
following order&mdash;copper, gold, brass, tin, iron, steel, lead.</p>

<p>You will now understand why metals feel cold to the
touch: it is because, being good conductors, they carry
the heat rapidly away from that part of our body with
which they are in contact.</p>

<p>Among the bad conductors of heat are fur, wool, cotton,
silk, and linen; straw, paper, feathers, wood, earth, snow,
water, and air; and loose bodies, such as sawdust and
shavings, which contain a large amount of air in the
spaces between their particles.</p>

<p>Our clothing, as you know, is made of wool, cotton, or
linen. Can you tell why such materials are selected for
the purpose? It is not, as many ignorant people suppose,
because they are best adapted to <i>impart</i> warmth. The
true reason is that, being bad conductors, they prevent
the cold air and other objects around us from robbing us
of the heat which is produced within our bodies.</p>

<p>When once you understand what is meant by conduction
of heat, and can distinguish between substances
which are good conductors and those which are not, you
will be able to give a reason for many facts that must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
appear strange to every one who does not possess such
information. A little reflection, for instance, will enable
you to explain why a linen garment feels colder to the
skin than one made of cotton or wool; why a silver spoon
becomes hot when the bowl is left for a few minutes in a
cup of hot liquid; why a metal tea-pot or kettle is commonly
furnished with a handle of wood or ivory; why
ice may be preserved by being wrapped in flannel or
covered with sawdust; why a pump, in frosty weather,
should be encased in straw or matting; and why the
farmer welcomes the snow, and regards it as a protection
to his crops.</p>

<p>Every warm body has the power of sending out rays of
heat, as a luminous body gives out rays of light. This
mode of communicating heat is called <i>radiation</i>, and
it serves, as we shall see, a very important purpose in
the economy of nature.</p>

<p>When you stand before a fire, heat-rays stream forth
from the burning fuel, and create in you the sensation of
warmth. In this case, the heat of the fire is communicated
to you, not by conduction, but by radiation.</p>

<p>Everything in nature is constantly radiating heat from
its surface. If a body be surrounded by objects hotter
than itself, it becomes heated by radiation; if it be
exposed to the influence of objects colder than itself, it
becomes cooled by radiation; and if the objects around it
are neither hotter nor colder than itself, its temperature
remains unaltered.</p>

<p>But though all bodies radiate heat, they have not all the
same radiating power. Some substances possess this power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
in a far greater degree than others. The metals, though
they are the best conductors, are the worst radiators.
This is particularly the case when they are polished. Dull,
dark substances, and especially those which have a rough
or scratched surface, are good radiators; light-colored
and smooth substances, on the other hand, are bad radiators;
and this explains why, as every good housewife
knows, a polished metal tea-pot keeps tea warmer than a
black earthen one&mdash;it does not part with its heat so
readily.</p>

<p>Bodies which radiate freely have the power in an equal
degree of <i>absorbing</i> heat; that is, they are as ready to
take it in, as they are to throw it out again. Dark substances,
therefore, must be good absorbers, as they are
good radiators of heat. A very simple experiment will
illustrate this fact very clearly. If you spread upon snow,
in a place exposed to the sunbeams, two pieces of cloth of
the same texture, one black and the other white, you will
find, after some time, that under the black cloth the snow
has been melted, but under the white cloth it remains as
it was at first. The black material has been heated
quickly and intensely; the white has not been heated at
all: the former has <i>absorbed</i> the sun’s rays; the latter
has <i>reflected</i> them.</p>

<p>The laws of absorption and radiation enable us to
explain many curious facts. Thus, dark-colored clothes
are cold in the shade, because they are then radiating heat
from our bodies; but they are warm in the sunshine,
because they are then absorbing the heat that falls upon
them from the sun. On the other hand, light colored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
clothes are warm in the shade, and cool in the sunshine.
Again, a dish-cover or metal tea-pot is kept as brightly
polished as possible, in order to prevent the escape of the
heat by radiation; a black earthenware tea-pot, on the
contrary, has a dull and dark surface, so that it may be
placed on the hob and absorb the heat. So, too, if a kettle
is to heat quickly, the bottom and sides should be covered
with soot, to absorb the heat; while the upper part
should be bright, to prevent radiation.</p>

<p>It is radiation, also, that accounts for the deposition of
dew. It is a common error to suppose that dew falls in
the same manner as rain or mist, only in much finer
particles. Dew, in fact, does not fall, but is formed on
the surface of bodies by the condensation of the moisture
of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>The air around us contains at all times a quantity of
moisture in the form of vapor. Now this vapor has
been formed from water by the action of heat; and it may
again be turned into water by being brought in contact
with objects that are cold. And this is just what takes
place in the formation of dew. When the sun has set,
the trees and grass and other objects on the earth’s surface
immediately begin to radiate the heat which they
have absorbed from its beams during the day. The best
radiators, of course, become cool most rapidly, and quickly
condense the vapor that floats in the air around them;
and in the morning we find those objects which radiate
freely, such as blades of grass, leaves of plants, and floating
cobwebs, covered with this condensed vapor in the
form of glittering dewdrops.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>Clouds, in a great measure, prevent radiation, and
hence the dew will be most plentiful on a clear and cloudless
night. If the radiation continues till the temperature
of the ground is very low, the dew freezes as it is deposited
and forms <i>hoar-frost</i>.</p>

<p>You may see a smooth road or gravel walk quite dry
in the morning, while the grass or box by its side is
thickly coated with moisture. Why is this? It is
simply because the road or walk is a bad radiator and
cools slowly, while the grass and box, being good radiators,
become rapidly cold and condense the vapor of the
passing air into dew.</p>

<p>Thus by a wise arrangement, the cultivated fields
receive an abundance of precious moisture, while not a
drop is wasted on the bare rock, or the sterile sands of
the desert.</p>

<h2><a name="LXXIV_CANADIAN_TREES" id="LXXIV_CANADIAN_TREES"></a>LXXIV.&mdash;CANADIAN TREES.</h2>

<p class="author">James Brown, LL.D.</p>

<h3>FIRST READING.&mdash;SOFT WOODS.</h3>

<p>The principal evergreen, or cone-bearing trees, natives
of Canada, are <i>Pines</i>, <i>Firs</i>, and <i>Thujas</i>.</p>

<p>As every one cannot distinguish a Pine from a Fir,
this lesson is illustrated with drawings, showing the
peculiar character of each, so that any boy or girl may
be able, when looking at a cone-bearing tree, to decide
whether it is a Pine or a Fir.</p>

<p>Fig. 1 represents a
small piece of the twig
of a White Pine. On
examination it will be
seen that the leaves
are needle-shaped, and
spring from the young
shoot in little tufts
of fives, all issuing
from one point. This
arrangement and form
of the leaf are peculiar to Pines, and should be kept in
mind when examining a tree, in order to know whether
it is a Pine or a Fir. Every Pine tree, however, has not
<i>five</i> leaves issuing from one point; some have only two,
and there are others, again, that have three.</p>

</div>

<p>Fig. 2 represents a twig of the Hemlock Spruce Fir, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
tree well-known to nearly every young person in Canada.
Looking at this illustration, we at once observe that
the leaves are distributed <i>singly</i> on
the young shoot, and stand out in
two rows. In the case of a few
species of Fir, however, the leaves
are not thus arranged, but are scattered
all round the twigs, being stiff
and pointed, as shown in Fig. 3,
which represents a twig of the common
Black Spruce Fir. In all cases,
Firs have their leaves springing
<i>singly</i> from the twigs, an arrangement
by which any child can distinguish them from Pines.</p>

</div>

<p>Of all our native trees, Pines are considered
the most valuable, as their timber
can be used for almost every purpose for
which wood is required, especially for
house-building, ship-building, fencing,
and railway construction. The two principal
species are the White and the Red
Pine.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/fig3.jpg" width="100" height="200" alt="Twig of the Black Spruce Fir" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 3.</p>
</div>

<p>The White Pine is one of the grandest
trees of our Canadian forests. It
grows to very large proportions on dry,
gravelly lands, where it is not crowded by other
trees. We often find individual pine trees rising to the
height of 200 feet, with stems from four to six feet in
diameter near the ground; but in general they may be
said to reach 150 feet, with a diameter of about three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
feet. In the earlier settled parts of the country, the best
and largest trees of this species were cut down long ago;
but thousands of fine specimens are still to be met with
in the backwoods.</p>

<p>The Red Pine does not grow to so large a size as the
White, nor is it found so plentifully in our forests. It is
to be met with only on dry, gravelly knolls, and in rocky
parts of the country, generally in patches of small extent,
and seldom among other trees. Its timber is of the best
description, and is much sought after by lumbermen.
Owing to this cause it is now comparatively scarce. All
Pines are reared from seeds, which may be found ripe in
their cones in the month of November.</p>

<p>Although our Fir trees are, generally speaking, not so
important as our Pines, still, there are two or three of
them well worthy of being brought under notice here,
particularly the Douglas Fir, the Hemlock Spruce Fir,
the common Black Spruce Fir, and the Balsam Fir.</p>

<p>The Douglas Fir is not found in the woods east of the
Rocky Mountains, but it grows in the immense forests of
British Columbia to heights varying from 150 to 250 feet,
with trunks from three to ten feet in diameter. A
peculiar feature of this Fir is, that the bark on old trees
is found from ten to fourteen inches thick. Where full
grown, this grand Fir usually stands apart from other
trees, and forms a majestic object in the landscape, being
clothed with horizontal branches from the base to the
top. The timber is exceedingly durable, and in its native
province is much used for general purposes. It is also
exported for ship-masts, the tall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span> clean stems making the
best of material for this purpose.</p>

<p>The Hemlock Spruce Fir, most young people of Canada
are acquainted with, as it is widely distributed, and found
in many bushes of the country. In open situations, and
on cool-bottomed lands, the Hemlock is a noble tree;
while young it is very graceful in form, and when
approaching maturity its horizontal limbs give it the
appearance of the Cedar of Lebanon. Its timber, however,
is not esteemed so highly as that of the Pine, being
of a loose and open character. But, although this is the
case, it is largely used for rough boarding purposes, as in
building barns, and in making side-walks. The bark of
this tree is valuable for tanning leather.</p>

<p>The Black Spruce Fir, or <i>Gum Spruce</i>, as it is often
called, is very common on most flat and cool-bottomed
lands in Canada, and also on the banks of lakes and
rivers. It is a tall and beautifully formed tree, having
a dark brown bark, and very dark green leaves. It is
from these characteristics that it derives its name. It
grows to a height varying from 70 to 100 feet, but
the stems seldom attain diameters over two feet at the
bottom. The timber, though light, is very tough and
strong.</p>

<p>The Balsam is one of the handsomest members of this
family. Commercially it is not of much value, but as an
ornamental tree it is unsurpassed&mdash;its regular conical
form, closely set branches, and deep green leaves, rendering
it a conspicuous object in any landscape. The Balsam
seldom exceeds forty or fifty feet in height.</p>

<p>Although the Firs, like the Pines, are reared from seeds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
which ripen in October and November, they may be grown
from cuttings of the young wood, as rare kinds sometimes
are when their seeds cannot be had.</p>

<p>The Thuja, or <i>Arbor vitæ</i>, as it is generally called, is a
very useful class of Canadian trees. It grows to a large
size, and is found chiefly on the Pacific slope. There
is only one species which is a native of Ontario, and to it
alone we shall here refer. It is known to most people in
Ontario under the name of the <i>White Cedar</i>. How it came
to be called a <i>Cedar</i> we do not know; but its true name
is the <i>Arbor vitæ</i>. This species is too familiar to the
people of the eastern provinces of Canada to require any
lengthened description, as many farmers have it growing
in the swampy parts of their bushes, and find it useful
for various purposes, especially as rails for fencing.</p>

<p>The leaves of this tree are so small, that to a casual
observer, they scarcely appear to be leaves. If they are
closely looked at, however, it will be seen that they are
in opposite pairs, and lie flat and pressed on the twigs,
each pair overlapping the other like the shingles on a
house-top. When they are roughly handled, they give
out a strong aromatic smell. The tree, although it grows
to large dimensions&mdash;some times to eighty or ninety feet
in height, with stems from two to three feet in diameter&mdash;cannot
be considered an ornamental one, as its branches
are too loose and open, and its leaves too small, to give it
a clothed look. Its timber, however, is of the most

<h2><a name="LXXVI_CANADIAN_TREES" id="LXXVI_CANADIAN_TREES"></a>LXXVI.&mdash;CANADIAN TREES.</h2>

<p class="author">James Brown, LL.D.</p>

<h3>SECOND READING.&mdash;HARD WOODS.</h3>

<p>Let us now briefly describe the principal varieties of
our Canadian trees which lose their leaves every autumn,
and are therefore called <i>Deciduous Trees</i>; and first we
shall begin with the Oak. There are at least thirty different
species of Oaks found in our Canadian forests, all
growing to a size that makes them valuable as timber.
Most of them form noble specimens of ornamental trees,
when they stand out free, and separate from each other.
The White Oak, when so found, is one of the grandest
objects in the vegetable kingdom. The seeds of the Oak,
which are called acorns, are found ripe on the trees in
October and November.</p>

<p>There are about ten different species of Maples found in
our woods, all beautiful and ornamental trees. The Sugar
Maple is a tree of especial beauty, and in the autumn
months is remarkable for the brilliant color of its leaves.
The seeds of the Maple are what is called <i>winged</i>. They
may be found lying under the old trees in autumn.</p>

<p>The Ash is another valuable Canadian tree; and of
this genus about twenty species are found in our forests.
All are more or less valuable, both for their timber and
for their ornamental qualities. Several of the species,
especially those called the <i>White</i> and the <i>Black</i> Ash, are
found upwards of 100 feet in height, with diameters, close
to the ground, of three to four feet through. The timber<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
is much prized for its toughness and strength, and is used
in the manufacture of implements, barrel hoops, and the
wood-work of machinery. The Ash is always found on
deep land, having a rather damp and cool bottom. The
seeds are ripe in November, and may then be gathered
from the trees.</p>

<p>Of the Beech, there is only one species found in Canada,
but here and there varieties of it are to be met with,
caused by difference of soil and aspect. It grows to a
large size, when not closely surrounded by other trees.
Its timber is held in high esteem; but as it does not last
long when exposed to the weather, it should therefore be
used for indoor purposes only. The Beech is not a long-lived
tree, as it becomes matured within 150 years. It
succeeds best on dry, gravelly soils. The seeds are called
<i>nuts</i>, and are ripe in October, as every country schoolboy
knows.</p>

<p>The Sweet Chestnut is another of our timber trees
deserving of notice. There is only one species of it to be
found in Canada, and it is in all respects the same as the
European Sweet Chestnut. It is a majestic tree, where
found standing alone, and its timber is of a very durable
nature, much sought after for many purposes, especially
for posts and fence-rails. This tree grows best on deep,
dry, and strong land, where it often reaches a height of
100 feet, with a proportionate trunk. The seeds are
called <i>nuts</i>, and may be used as food.</p>

<p>The Hornbeam (or <i>Ironwood</i>, as it is generally called
in Canada,) is a tree of moderate size, and is plentiful on
the dry parts of our forest-land. It has much the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
appearance as the Beech, but it is easily distinguished
from that tree by the curled edges of its leaves, and by
its darker and rougher bark. The timber is very hard,
of a close and compact texture, and is much used for
farm purposes, where strength is required. The seeds of
this tree are called <i>nuts</i>, and each is enclosed in a peculiar
leafy substance, called by botanists a <i>perianth</i>.</p>

<p>The Walnut is found plentifully in most bushes in the
southern parts of Ontario. It includes nine or ten species,
all growing to considerable size, and forming very handsome
trees, as for example, the <i>Black Walnut</i>, <i>Butternut</i>,
<i>Pecan Nut</i>, <i>Hickory</i>, <i>Bitter Nut</i>, and <i>Hog Nut</i>: each
having beautiful foliage. The Hickory is especially
known for the toughness and other valuable qualities of
its timber; and every boy is familiar with the delicious
nuts which this tree produces. All these trees grow best
on a deep, rich soil.</p>

<p>The Plane is another member of our Canadian forests
deserving of notice, and is a tree of peculiar beauty. Its
wide-spreading branches, clothed with large leaves, make
it well adapted for shelter or shade. In Canada it is best
known by the name of <i>Cotton-wood</i>, or <i>Button-wood</i>, and
is also familiar as the <i>Sycamore</i>. The British name for
it is the Plane Tree. It is found on deep, loamy lands,
by the sides of our rivers and lakes, forming a tall, massive-headed
tree, often upwards of 130 feet in height,
with a trunk of from three to five feet in diameter. The
timber is not held in high estimation, though sometimes
used for furniture-making, and for some parts of the
inner work of house-building. The tree can be grown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
from cuttings of the young wood.</p>

<p>The Elm in our woods is a stately tree, and often rises
to the height of 140 feet, with a stem of six feet in
diameter. There are several species of Elm, but the most
important is the <i>White</i>, which, on deep and cool-bottomed
land, attains the dimensions stated. Where individuals
of this species stand alone, with all their limbs fully
developed, they form grand and imposing objects. The
timber of the various species is used in house-building
and in the manufacture of agricultural implements. The
seeds ripen in the early part of summer when they may
be gathered and sown at once.</p>

<p>Of the Birch there are several species found in our
woods, but the <i>Tall Birch</i> and the <i>Paper Birch</i> are the
most important and best known. Both species are of
graceful habit and foliage. The <i>Paper Birch</i> is particularly
remarkable on account of its cream-colored, paper-like
bark. Both kinds attain large dimensions in favorable
soil, being often found from 90 to 100 feet high, with
stems of two or three feet in diameter. It is from the
bark of the Paper Birch that the Indians construct their
canoes; hence it is often called the <i>Canoe Birch</i>. The
timber of this tree enters largely into the manufacture of
furniture, and for this purpose it is exported to Europe.
The seeds are contained in <i>catkins</i>, which hang from the
points of the branches, and ripen in October.</p>

<p>The Tulip may be easily known by its leaves, which
are quite unlike those of almost any other tree, and much
resemble a riding saddle. It grows to a large size, and is
highly ornamental; its luxuriant foliage, together with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
its numerous greenish-yellow, tulip-shaped flowers, giving
it a fine appearance. The timber is soft, and of no especial
value. There is only one species.</p>

<p>Of the Lime we have four different species in our
woods, namely: the <i>Broad-leaved</i>, the <i>Downy-leaved</i>, the
<i>Thin-leaved</i>, and the <i>Variable-leaved</i>. This tree is more
generally known to Canadians by the name of <i>Basswood</i>.
All the species are graceful trees, with sweet-smelling
flowers. Many of them grow to a large size on rich, deep
lands, often attaining the height of 120 feet, with stems
ranging from three to five feet in diameter. The timber
is white and soft, when newly cut up, but, as it becomes
seasoned, it acquires firmness of texture, and when kept
dry, lasts well in house-building. It is employed by shoemakers
and saddlers for cutting-boards, and is well-suited
for carving purposes.</p>

<h2><a name="LXXVIII_THE_GOLDEN_TOUCH" id="LXXVIII_THE_GOLDEN_TOUCH"></a>LXXVIII.&mdash;THE GOLDEN TOUCH.</h2>

<p class="author">Nathaniel Hawthorne.</p>

<h3>FIRST READING.</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/p216.jpg" width="300" height="247" alt="Midas in his treasury, looking up at the visitor" />
</div>

<p>Once upon a time, there lived a very rich man, and a
king besides, whose name was Midas; and he had a little
daughter, whom nobody but myself ever heard of, and
whose name I either never knew, or have entirely forgotten.
So, because I love odd names for little girls, I
choose to call her Marygold.</p>

<p>This King Midas was fonder of gold than of any thing
else in the world. He valued his royal crown chiefly because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
it was composed of that precious metal. If he loved
any thing better, or half so well, it was the one little maiden
who played so merrily around her father’s footstool. But
the more Midas loved his daughter, the more did he desire
and seek for wealth. He thought, foolish man! that the
best thing he could possibly do for this dear child would
be to bequeath her the largest pile of glistening coin, that
had ever been heaped together since the world was made.</p>

<p>Thus he gave all his thoughts and all his time to this
one purpose. If ever he happened to gaze for an instant
at the gold-tinted clouds of sunset, he wished that they
were real gold, and that they could be squeezed safely
into his strong box. When little Marygold ran to meet
him, with a bunch of buttercups and dandelions, he used
to say, “Pooh, pooh, child! If these flowers were as golden
as they look, they would be worth the plucking!”</p>

<p>At length (as people always grow more and more foolish,
unless they take care to grow wiser and wiser) Midas had
got to be so exceedingly unreasonable, that he could
scarcely bear to see or touch any object that was not gold.
He made it his custom, therefore, to pass a large portion
of every day in a dark and dreary apartment, under
ground, at the basement of his palace. It was here that
he kept his wealth. To this dismal hole&mdash;for it was little
better than a dungeon&mdash;Midas betook himself, whenever
he wanted to be particularly happy.</p>

<p>Here, after carefully locking the door, he would take a
bag of gold coin, or a gold cup as big as a washbowl, or a
heavy golden bar, or a peck-measure of gold-dust, and
bring them from the obscure corners of the room into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
one bright and narrow sunbeam that fell from the dungeon-like
window. He valued the sunbeam for no other reason
but that his treasure would not shine without its help.</p>

<p>And then would he reckon over the coins in the bag;
toss up the bar, and catch it as it came down; sift the
gold-dust through his fingers; look at the funny image of
his own face, as reflected in the burnished circumference
of the cup; and whisper to himself, “O Midas, rich King
Midas, what a happy man art thou!”</p>

<p>Midas was enjoying himself in his treasure-room, one
day, as usual, when he perceived a shadow fall over the
heaps of gold; and, looking up, he beheld the figure of a
stranger, standing in the bright and narrow sunbeam! It
was a young man, with a cheerful and ruddy face.</p>

<p>Whether it was that the imagination of King Midas
threw a yellow tinge over every thing, or whatever the
cause might be, he could not help fancying that the smile
with which the stranger regarded him had a kind of
golden brightness in it. Certainly, there was now a
brighter gleam upon all the piled-up treasures than before.
Even the remotest corners had their share of it,
and were lighted up, when the stranger smiled, as with
tips of flame and sparkles of fire.</p>

<p>As Midas knew that he had carefully turned the key in
the lock, and that no mortal strength could possibly break
into his treasure-room, he, of course, concluded that his
visitor must be something more than mortal.</p>

<p>Midas had met such beings before now, and was not
sorry to meet one of them again. The stranger’s aspect,
indeed, was so good-humored and kindly, if not beneficent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
that it would have been unreasonable to suspect him of
intending any mischief. It was far more probable that
he came to do Midas a favor. And what could that favor
be, unless to multiply his heaps of treasure?</p>

<p>The stranger gazed about the room; and, when his
lustrous smile had glistened upon all the golden objects
that were there, he turned again to Midas.</p>

<p>“You are a wealthy man, friend Midas!” he observed.
“I doubt whether any other four walls on earth contain so
much gold as you have contrived to pile up in this room.”</p>

<p>“I have done pretty well,&mdash;pretty well,” answered
Midas, in a discontented tone. “But, after all, it is but a
trifle, when you consider that it has taken me my whole
lifetime to get it together. If one could live a thousand
years, he might have time to grow rich!”</p>

<p>“What!” exclaimed the stranger. “Then you are not
satisfied?”</p>

<p>Midas shook his head.</p>

<p>“And pray, what would satisfy you?” asked the
stranger. “Merely for the curiosity of the thing, I should
be glad to know.”</p>

<p>Midas paused and meditated. He felt sure that this
stranger, with such a golden lustre in his good-humored
smile, had come hither with both the power and the
purpose of gratifying his utmost wishes. Now, therefore,
was the fortunate moment, when he had but to speak, and
obtain whatever possible, or seemingly impossible thing,
it might come into his head to ask. So he thought and
thought, and thought, and heaped up one golden mountain
upon another, in his imagination, without being able to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
imagine them big enough.</p>

<p>At last a bright idea occurred to King Midas.</p>

<p>Raising his head, he looked the lustrous stranger in
the face.</p>

<p>“Well, Midas,” observed his visitor, “I see that you
have at length hit upon something that will satisfy you.
Tell me your wish.”</p>

<p>“It is only this,” replied Midas. “I am weary of
collecting my treasures with so much trouble, and beholding
the heap so diminutive, after I have done my best.
I wish every thing that I touch to be changed to gold!”</p>

<p>The stranger’s smile grew so bright and radiant, that it
seemed to fill the room like an outburst of the sun,
gleaming into a shadowy dell, where the yellow autumnal
leaves&mdash;for so looked the lumps and particles of gold&mdash;lie
strewn in the glow of light.</p>

<p>“The Golden Touch!” exclaimed he. “You certainly
deserve credit, friend Midas, for striking out so brilliant a
fancy. But are you quite sure that this will satisfy you?”</p>

<p>“How could it fail?” said Midas.</p>

<p>“And will you never regret the possession of it?”</p>

<p>“What could induce me?” asked Midas. “I ask nothing
else, to render me perfectly happy.”</p>

<p>“Be it as you wish, then,” replied the stranger, waving
his hand in token of farewell. “To-morrow, at sunrise,
you will find yourself gifted with the Golden Touch.”</p>

<p>The figure of the stranger then became exceedingly
bright, and Midas involuntarily closed his eyes. On
opening them again, he beheld only one yellow sunbeam
in the room, and, all around him, the glistening of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
precious metal which he had spent his life in hoarding up.</p>

<h2><a name="LXXX_THE_ROOT" id="LXXX_THE_ROOT"></a>LXXX.&mdash;THE ROOT.</h2>

<p class="author">Figuier.</p>

<p>Commit a seed to the earth; plant, for example, a
Lima bean, at the depth of two inches in moist vegetable
soil. The seed will not be slow to germinate; first swelling,
and then bursting its outer skin, a vegetable in miniature
will, after a time, slowly reveal itself to the observer. In
the meantime two very distinct parts make their appearance;
one, yellowish in color, already throwing out
slender fibrous shoots, sinks farther into the soil,&mdash;this is
the <i>radicle</i>, or root; the other of a pale greenish color,
takes the opposite direction, ascends to the surface,
and rises above the ground,&mdash;this is the stem.</p>

<p>This root and stem are the essential organs of vegetation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
without which, when we have excepted certain
vegetables of an inferior order, plants adorned with leaves
and flowers cannot exist. How vast the difference between
the verdant top of a tree, which rises graceful and elegant
into mid-air,&mdash;not to speak of the flower it bears&mdash;and
the coarse, tangled mass of its roots and rootlets, without
harmony, without symmetry! These organs, so little
favored in their appearance, have, however, very important
functions in the order of vegetable action.</p>

<p>The chief offices of the root are two: in the first place,
it attaches the plant to the soil, holds it in its place, and
prevents it from being overwhelmed by the elements. In
the second, it feeds the plant by absorbing from the earth
the sap necessary to its growth. How is this done?</p>

<p>The root branches again and again as it grows, throwing
out numerous smaller branches. These hollow, thread-like
rootlets suck up, from the soil, the water and other
things, which are to go, through the stem or trunk and
the branches, to all the leaves. Here these are made into
the perfect sap, which, being distributed, causes the plant
to grow, to blossom, and to bear fruit.</p>

<p>The manner in which roots succeed in overcoming
obstacles, has always been a subject of surprise to the
observer. The roots of trees and shrubs, when cramped or
hindered in their progress, have been observed to exhibit
considerable mechanical force, throwing down walls or
splitting rocks; in other cases, clinging together in
bunches, or spreading out their fibres over a prodigious
space, in order to follow the course of a rivulet with its
friendly moisture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>A celebrated botanist of the last century relates that,
wishing to preserve a field of rich soil from the roots
of a row of elms, which would soon have exhausted it,
he had a ditch dug between the field and the trees in
order to cut the roots off from it. But he saw with surprise
that those roots, which had not been severed in the
operation, had made their way down the slope so as to
avoid meeting the light, had passed under the ditch, and
were again spreading themselves over the field.</p>

<p>There are some roots which are developed along the
stem itself. These supplementary organs come as helps
to the roots properly so called, and replace them when by
any cause they have been destroyed. In the primrose, for
example, both the principal and the secondary roots
springing from it, perish after some years of growth, but
the supplementary roots, springing from the lower part of
the stalk, prevent the plant from dying.</p>

<p>In the tropical forests of America and Asia, the
vanilla, whose fruit is so sought after for its sweet aroma,
twines its slender stem round the neighboring trees,
forming an elegant, flexible, and aerial garland, an ornament
in these vast solitudes, at once grateful and pleasing.
The underground roots of the vanilla would not be sufficient
for the nutriment of the plant, and the rising of the
nourishing sap would take place too slowly. But Nature
makes up for this inconvenience by the air roots which
the plant throws out at intervals along its stem. Living
in the warm and humid atmosphere of tropical forests, the
stronger shoots soon reach the ground and root themselves
in the soil. Others float freely in the atmosphere, inhaling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
the moisture and conveying it to the parent stem.</p>

<p>A grand tree&mdash;the banyan, or the pagoda fig-tree&mdash;adorns
the landscape of India, and presents the most
remarkable development of aerial roots. When the parent
stem has attained the height of some fifty or sixty feet, it
throws out side branches in every direction, and each
branch in its turn throws out supplementary roots, which
descend perpendicularly in long slender shoots till they
reach the ground. When they have rooted themselves in
the soil, they increase rapidly in diameter, and soon form
around the parent stem thousands of columns, each
throwing out new lateral branches and new roots.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The bended twigs take root, and daughters grow</div>
<div class="verse">About the mother tree, a pillared shade.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The natives love to build their temples in the intervals
left between these roots of the wild fig-tree. A famous
banyan tree on the Nerbuddah is said by Professor
Forbes to have three hundred large and three thousand
smaller aerial roots; it is capable of sheltering thousands
of men, and thus forms one of the marvels of the vegetable
world; it is, in short, a forest within a forest.</p>

<p>Roots constantly endeavor to bury themselves in the
earth. They seem to shun the light of day; and this
tendency is to be seen from the very first moment
when the root shows itself in the seed. The tendency is
so decided, and appears so inherent in the life of all
vegetables, that if we reverse a germinating seed, placing
it with the root upwards, the root and the stem will twist
round of themselves,&mdash;the stem will stretch upward, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
the root will bury itself in the ground.</p>

<h2><a name="LXXXII_SHAPES_OF_LEAVES" id="LXXXII_SHAPES_OF_LEAVES"></a>LXXXII.&mdash;SHAPES OF LEAVES.</h2>

<p class="author">Gustavus Frankenstein.</p>

<h3>FIRST READING.</h3>

<p>By far the greater number of plants have leaves of an
oval shape, and we have only to go through our forests
and gardens to see them on every hand. Exceedingly
varied are they indeed, from very narrow to very broad
oval, some with toothed, some with smooth edges, and
some even deeply notched; and yet to such an extent
does this tendency toward a rounded form prevail, that
there seems scarcely a plant in whose leaves a trace of
the oval may not be found.</p>

<p>The apple tree gives us a good specimen of an oval leaf;
and an immense number of plants have
leaves resembling it in shape. In many
plants, the leaves are almost the very
counterpart of those of the apple-tree;
in some, they are narrower, and in
others, still narrower, till we come to
very slender blades like those of the
grasses; and then, beyond still, to the
needle-like leaves of the pines. On the
other hand, plants are to be found with
leaves broader than the apple-leaf; and
so on, rounder and rounder, until we
come to such plants as the nasturtium and
the water-lily, whose leaves are almost as round as circles.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 100px;">

<p class="caption">Leaf of Apple.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>There are certainly to be met with most remarkable
departures from the oval shape, and we need but refer
to such leaves as those of the buckwheat, to find that
roundness seems to be entirely absent.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 146px;">
<img src="images/leaf-buckwheat.jpg" width="146" height="200" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Buckwheat Leaf.</p>
</div>

<p>This style of leaf, of which there are
many variations, is apparently built on the
model of the heart-shaped leaf, of which
the morning-glory affords
a familiar example. It will
be noted, however, that
instead of the curvilinear
flow of outline, in which
a tendency to oval roundness is plainly
visible, the hastate leaf of the buckwheat
is angular throughout.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 160px;">
<img src="images/leaf-morningglory.jpg" width="160" height="200" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Morning-Glory Leaf.</p>
</div>

<p>Another marked characteristic of most leaves is, that
they terminate in a point, either sharp
to extreme slenderness, or blunt to broad
roundness; for even in a circular leaf
there is one point which is its extremity,
and to which the margin from either
side approaches by a convexity. To this
pointedness of leaves the exceptions are
exceedingly rare. A plant found in
some parts of our own country&mdash;the magnificent tulip-tree&mdash;presents,
perhaps, the most extraordinary of all.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 181px;">
<img src="images/leaf-tuliptree.jpg" width="181" height="200" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Leaf of Tulip-Tree.</p>
</div>

<p>Now this leaf comes out of a bud-case which is actually
oval. The young leaf is folded double inside of its
bud-case; and, besides, its small stalk is bent over so as
to bring the little leaf to hold its end downwards. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
can see this curious arrangement very well, just after the
bud has opened, and the young leaf has come out. However,
it soon straightens up, holds its little head aloft, and
looks like a pretty little flag. After this it
spreads apart into the full leaf, and stands up
like a banner. If the bud be held
up to the light, the young leaf
can be seen nicely folded up inside,
with its head snugly bent
down. There is nothing prettier,
or more curious, to be seen in the
woods, than the young buds of the
tulip-trees, when they are about to
open, or after they have unfurled
their little flags; and all summer
long, even from earliest spring, the tulip-trees
are continually unfolding their buds.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>There are leaves broader above than
below, and some, instead of ending in a
point, have a notch or indentation of some
sort. Oak-trees give us many fine and
varied samples of notched and lobed leaves.
And yet the leaf of the chestnut-oak is not
at all notched, being simply ovate, pointed,
and toothed. The leaves of the bur and
the pin oaks, on the contrary, are lobed and
notched, and are therefore characteristic oak-leaves,
while those of the chestnut-oak are
not so, because almost all oaks have leaves
more or less scalloped or deeply indented.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>Great as is the variety in the shapes of oak leaves, any
one of them would almost surely be at once recognized as
belonging to an oak-tree by its peculiar scallopings. But
suppose a person had never seen or heard of a chestnut-oak
leaf, would he be likely to recognize such a leaf simply
by its outline? There is
still another oak with
simple leaves; and they
are not even toothed, but
entirely smooth all around
the edge. Looking at that
tree, which is called the
willow-oak, scarcely anyone
would suppose it to
be an oak unless he could see its flowers or its fruit,
the acorns.</p>

<p class="caption">Pin-Oak Leaf.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p>This fact brings us to consider a very important point
in the study of a plant. It is not the leaf which tells
us what kind of plant it is: it is the flower and the fruit.
Whatever be the shape of the leaf, if the plant bears
acorns it is an oak. If a tree has cherries and cherry
blossoms, it is a cherry.</p>

<p>It is true that, in many families of plants, leaves, by
their shape alone, announce at once the kind of plant to
which they belong; at the same time there is a large
number of plants that cannot be known by their leaves,
but only by their flowers and fruits. It is by flowers
and fruits that plants are classified; and the more nearly
alike these are in two plants, the more closely are those
plants related. The flower and the fruit proclaim the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
nature of the plant. “A tree is known by its fruit.”</p>

<h3>SECOND READING.</h3>

<p>Although the flower and its fruit tell us what the
plant is, and leaves do not with any certainty, there is
yet a strong similarity, as well in texture as in shape, in
the leaves of most of the plants comprised within any
one family. Especially in texture is this marked similarity
observable; and, perhaps, in most cases the peculiar
structure of the leaf, aside from its shape, is indicative of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
the order to which the plant belongs. The leaves of the
grasses are very much alike; so are the leaves of the
sedges;&mdash;and though it is true, also, that in some instances
a sedge-leaf might be mistaken for a grass-leaf,
it must be remembered that the sedge family and the
grass family have some points of similarity.</p>

<p>Again, if we should come upon a plant belonging to
the common potato or nightshade family, we should be
almost sure to recognize the family resemblance at the
very first glance, provided we were already familiar with
a number of plants included in that order. Yet the
leaves of the nightshade family vary considerably in
shape, and it is therefore decisively the texture and
peculiar appearance of the leaves, that announce the kinship
of the plant. And thus we are led back to the consideration
of the willow-oak and chestnut-oak leaves,
which, entirely unlike the typical oak-leaf in shape, are
yet very much like all other oak leaves in texture and
other essential structure.</p>

<p class="caption">Leaf of the Rose.</p>
</div>

<p>Still more widely divided than oak leaves, are such as
are called pinnate, in which the separated
parts are actually distinct leaflets, some
even provided with stalks. Such compound
leaves may be seen in almost
every garden by looking at a rose-bush.
In the cut, we see what appears to be five
distinct leaves attached to one twig; but
the fact is that they are only leaflets, and,
together with the stalk which bears them all, constitute
but one complete leaf. Each of these leaflets has a short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
stalk, connecting it with the main stem, which passes
between the pairs, and has an odd leaflet at the end. A
rose-bush may have leaves of seven or nine leaflets.</p>

<p>Among our forest trees, hickory, walnut, butternut,
locust, and ash have pinnate leaves; and on the honey-locust
not only are the leaves pinnate, but on the same
tree, may also be found leaves doubly pinnate, and even
tripinnate. Compound leaves may be seen also in the
pea-vine, which is simply pinnate; but here the place of
the absent terminal leaflet is supplied by a tendril.</p>

<p>But if we examine a bean-plant, we do find an odd
leaf, together with a pair of leaflets; that is, each leaf is
composed of three leaflets. The many varieties of bean-plants
are all thus three-leaved. Besides, the woods are
full of three-leaved plants, belonging to other kinds of the
bean or pulse order of plants. In addition to these and
some others, we must not overlook a most extraordinary
three-leaved plant, plentiful in almost every forest, and
on almost every stone-fence in the country; only too well
known by persons who have been poisoned by it, and yet
not so well known by most people as it ought to be, for
it is often confounded with a plant having digitate leaves.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 271px;">
<img src="images/leaf-virginiacreeper.jpg" width="271" height="200" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Leaf of Virginia Creeper.</p>
</div>

<p>Here, side by side, the forms of the two leaves can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
compared. On the right is the digitate leaf of the beautiful
Virginia creeper, entirely harmless; on the left is the
pinnate leaf of the poison-vine. The innocent plant is
<i>five</i>-leaved; the noxious plant is <i>three</i>-leaved. But we
should also notice particularly that the arrangement of
the leaflets is quite different in the two plants. In the
poison-vine, we see a pair of leaflets and a terminal odd
one; whereas in the Virginia creeper, there is no pairing
of leaflets whatever, but the five parts radiate from a
centre. All the leaflets come out together from one
point at the tip of the leaf-stalk.</p>

<p>Plants there are with digitate
leaves, having three, five, seven, nine,
or more leaflets. Clover has digitate
leaves of three leaflets, while the
leaves of the buck-eye and horse-chestnut
have five, seven, and nine
leaflets. The pretty little wood-sorrel
plant of small yellow flowers, has three most
beautiful, inverted, heart-shaped leaflets, radiating from
the tip of the little leaf-stalk.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 191px;">
<img src="images/leaf-woodsorrel.jpg" width="191" height="200" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Leaflet of Wood-Sorrel.</p>
</div>

<p>In leaves like those of the maple we
see the main veins radiating from a point
at the top of the stalk. Such leaves are
therefore much like the digitate kind,
only they are not completely divided
into separate leaflets.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 139px;">
<img src="images/leaf-maple.jpg" width="139" height="200" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Maple Leaf.</p>
</div>

<p>Sassafras leaves offer forms something
different. On the same tree may be
seen oval, two-lobed, and three-lobed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
leaves. Thus on one and the same plant, we see leaves
strikingly different in form; yet the texture, the color,
and the veining are exactly after the same pattern in
them all, so that a sassafras leaf, whether oval or cleft,
can at once be easily known.</p>

<p>Recalling to mind the leaf of the apple, buckwheat,
morning-glory, oak, rose, Virginia creeper, maple, and sassafras,
we have pretty good models after which nearly all
leaves are built, approximating to one or other of these,
with certain variations peculiar to the species.</p>

<p>Another important matter regarding the leaves of
plants, is their relative position on the stems. There are
two principal and very marked arrangements of leaves.
Leaves are either opposite one another on the stem, or
they are alternate or not opposite. There are whole
orders of plants with none but opposite leaves, as the
mint family. In other orders, the leaves of every plant
are alternate. And again, in some orders, and even on
the same plants, are found both opposite and alternate
leaves, as in the composite or sunflower family; and a
single wild sunflower plant itself has opposite leaves
below, and alternate leaves above.</p>

<p>Of our forest trees, there are very few species with
opposite leaves. If you see that the branches and leaves
of a tree do not stand one opposite another on the stem,
you can at once be sure that it is not an ash, a maple, or
a buck-eye, because all these trees do have opposite leaves.
On the other hand, there are many trees having alternate
branches and leaves, such as the oak, chestnut, elm, hickory,
walnut, butternut, tulip-tree, alder, beech, birch,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
poplar, willow, mulberry, linden, locust, and others.</p>

<h2><a name="LXXXVI_THE_GOLDEN_TOUCH" id="LXXXVI_THE_GOLDEN_TOUCH"></a>LXXXVI.&mdash;THE GOLDEN TOUCH.</h2>

<p class="author">Nathaniel Hawthorne.</p>

<h3>SECOND READING.</h3>

<p>Whether Midas slept as usual that night, the story
does not say. But when the earliest sunbeam shone
through the window, and gilded the ceiling over his
head, it seemed to him that this bright yellow sunbeam
was reflected in rather a singular way on the white
covering of the bed. Looking more closely, what was his
astonishment and delight, when he found that this linen
fabric had been transmuted to what seemed a woven
texture of the purest and brightest gold! The Golden
Touch had come to him with the first sunbeam!</p>

<p>Midas started up, in a kind of joyful frenzy, and ran
about the room, grasping at every thing that happened to
be in his way. He seized one of the bedposts, and it
became immediately a fluted golden pillar. He pulled
aside a window-curtain in order to admit a clear spectacle
of the wonders which he was performing, and the tassel
grew heavy in his hand,&mdash;a mass of gold. He took up a
book from the table; at his first touch, it assumed the
appearance of such a splendidly bound and gilt-edged
volume as one often meets with now-a-days; but on running
his fingers through the leaves, behold! it was a
bundle of thin golden plates, in which all the wisdom of
the book had grown illegible.</p>

<p>He hurriedly put on his clothes, and was enraptured to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
see himself in a magnificent suit of gold cloth, which
retained its flexibility and softness, although it burdened
him a little with its weight. He drew out his handkerchief,
which little Marygold had hemmed for him; that
was likewise gold, with the dear child’s neat and pretty
stitches running all along the border, in gold thread!</p>

<p>Somehow or other, this last transformation did not quite
please King Midas. He would rather that his little
daughter’s handiwork should have remained just the same
as when she climbed his knee and put it into his hand.</p>

<p>But it was not worth while to vex himself about a trifle.
Midas took his spectacles from his pocket, and put them
on his nose, in order that he might see more distinctly
what he was about. In those days, spectacles for common
people had not been invented, but were already worn by
kings; else, how could Midas have had any? To his
great perplexity, however, excellent as the glasses were,
he discovered that he could not possibly see through
them. But this was the most natural thing in the world;
for, on taking them off, the transparent crystals turned
out to be plates of yellow metal, and, of course, were
worthless as spectacles, though valuable as gold. It struck
Midas as rather inconvenient, that, with all his wealth, he
could never again be rich enough to own a pair of serviceable
spectacles.</p>

<p>“It is no great matter, nevertheless,” said he to himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
Very philosophically. “We can not expect any great
good, without its being accompanied with some small
inconvenience. The Golden Touch is worth the sacrifice
of a pair of spectacles at least, if not of one’s very eyesight.
My own eyes will serve for ordinary purposes, and
little Marygold will soon be old enough to read to me.”
Wise King Midas was so exalted by his good fortune,
that the palace seemed not sufficiently spacious to contain
him. He therefore went down stairs, and smiled on
observing that the balustrade of the staircase became a
bar of burnished gold, as his hand passed over it, in his
descent. He lifted the door-latch (it was brass only a
moment ago, but golden when his fingers quitted it), and
emerged into the garden. Here, as it happened, he found
a great number of beautiful roses in full bloom, and others
in all the stages of lovely bud and blossom. Very delicious
was their fragrance in the morning breeze. Their delicate
blush was one of the fairest sights in the world; so gentle,
so modest, and so full of sweet soothing, did these roses
seem to be.</p>

<p>But Midas knew a way to make them far more precious,
according to his way of thinking, than roses had ever been
before. So he took great pains in going from bush to
bush, and exercised his magic touch most untiringly;
until every individual flower and bud, and even the
worms at the heart of some of them, were changed to gold.
By the time this good work was completed, King Midas
was summoned to breakfast; and as the morning air had
given him an excellent appetite, he made haste back to
the palace.</p>

<p>What was usually a king’s breakfast in the days of
Midas, I really do not know, and can not stop now to
investigate. To the best of my knowledge, however, on
this particular morning, the breakfast consisted of hot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
cakes, some nice little brook trout, roasted potatoes, fresh
boiled eggs, and coffee for King Midas himself, and a
bowl of bread and milk for his daughter Marygold.</p>

<p>Little Marygold had not yet made her appearance.
Her father ordered her to be called, and seating himself
at table, awaited the child’s coming, in order to begin his
own breakfast. To do Midas justice, he really loved his
daughter, and loved her so much the more this morning,
on account of the good fortune which had befallen him.
It was not a great while before he heard her coming along
the passage, crying bitterly. This circumstance surprised
him, because Marygold was one of the most cheerful little
people whom you would see in a summer’s day, and hardly
shed a tear in a twelvemonth.</p>

<p>When Midas heard her sobs, he determined to put little
Marygold into better spirits by an agreeable surprise; so,
leaning across the table, he touched his daughter’s bowl
(which was a china one, with pretty figures all around it),
and changed it into gleaming gold.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Marygold slowly and sadly opened the door,
and showed herself with her apron at her eyes, still sobbing
as if her heart would break.</p>

<p>“How now, my little lady!” cried Midas. “Pray,
what is the matter with you, this bright morning?”</p>

<p>Marygold, without taking the apron from her eyes, held
out her hand, in which was one of the roses which Midas
had so recently changed into gold.</p>

<p>“Beautiful!” exclaimed her father. “And what is
there in this magnificent golden rose to make you cry?”</p>

<p>“Ah, dear father!” answered the child, between her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
sobs, “it is not beautiful, but the ugliest flower that ever
grew! As soon as I was dressed, I ran into the garden to
gather some roses for you; because I know you like them,
and like them the better when gathered by your little
daughter. But oh, dear, dear me! What do you think
has happened? Such a sad thing! All the beautiful
roses, that smelled so sweetly, and had so many lovely
blushes, are blighted and spoilt! They are grown quite
yellowy as you see this one, and have no longer any
fragrance! What can have been the matter with them?”</p>

<p>“Pooh, my dear little girl,&mdash;pray don’t cry about it!”
said Midas, who was ashamed to confess that he himself
had wrought the change which so greatly afflicted her.
“Sit down, and eat your bread and milk. You will find
it easy enough to exchange a golden rose like that (which
will last hundreds of years), for an ordinary one which
would wither in a day.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care for such roses as this!” cried Marygold,
tossing it contemptuously away. “It has no smell, and
the hard petals prick my nose!”</p>

<p>The child now sat down to table, but was so occupied
with her grief for the blighted roses that she did not even
notice the wonderful change in her china bowl. Perhaps
this was all the better; for Marygold was accustomed to
take pleasure in looking at the queer figures and strange
trees and houses that were painted on the outside of the
bowl; and those ornaments were now entirely lost in the
yellow hue of the metal.</p>

<p>Midas, meanwhile, had poured out a cup of coffee; and,
as a matter of course, the coffee-pot, whatever metal it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
may have been when he took it up, was gold when he set
it down. He thought to himself that it was rather an
extravagant style of splendor, in a king of his simple
habits, to breakfast off a service of gold, and began to
be puzzled with the difficulty of keeping his treasures
safe. The cupboard and the kitchen would no longer be
a secure place of deposit for articles so valuable as golden
bowls and golden coffee-pots.</p>

<p>Amid these thoughts, he lifted a spoonful of coffee to his
lips, and, sipping it, was astonished to perceive that, the
instant his lips touched the liquid, it became molten gold,
and, the next moment, hardened into a lump!</p>

<p>“Ha!” exclaimed Midas, rather aghast.</p>

<p>“What is the matter, father?” asked little Marygold,
gazing at him, with the tears still standing in her eyes.</p>

<p>“Nothing, child, nothing!” said Midas. “Take your
milk before it gets quite cold.”</p>

<p>He took one of the nice little trouts on his plate, and
touched its tail with his finger. To his horror, it was
immediately changed from a brook-trout into a gold fish,
and looked as if it had been very cunningly made by the
nicest goldsmith in the world. Its little bones were now
golden wires; its fins and tail were thin plates of gold;
and there were the marks of the fork in it, and all the
delicate, frothy appearance of a nicely fried fish, exactly
imitated in metal.</p>

<p>“I don’t quite see,” thought he to himself, “how I am
to get any breakfast!”</p>

<p>He took one of the smoking-hot cakes, and had scarcely
broken it, when, to his cruel mortification, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span> a
moment before, it had been of the whitest wheat, it
assumed the yellow hue of Indian meal. Its solidity and
increased weight made him too bitterly sensible that it
was gold. Almost in despair, he helped himself to a boiled
egg, which immediately underwent a change similar to
that of the trout and the cake.</p>

<p>“Well, this is terrible!” thought he, leaning back in his
chair, and looking quite enviously at little Marygold, who
was now eating her bread and milk with great satisfaction.
“Such a costly breakfast before me, and nothing that can
be eaten!”</p>

<p>Hoping that, by dint of great dispatch, he might avoid
what he now felt to be a considerable inconvenience,
King Midas next snatched a hot potato, and attempted to
cram it into his mouth, and swallow it in a hurry. But
the Golden Touch was too nimble for him. He found his
mouth full, not of mealy potato, but of solid metal, which
so burnt his tongue that he roared aloud, and, jumping up
from the table, began to dance and stamp about the room,
both with pain and affright.</p>

<p>“Father, dear father!” cried little Marygold, who was
a very affectionate child, “pray what is the matter? Have
you burnt your mouth?”</p>

<p>“Ah, dear child,” groaned Midas, dolefully, “I don’t
know what is to become of your poor father!”</p>

<h2><a name="LXXXVIII_THE_FLOWER" id="LXXXVIII_THE_FLOWER"></a>LXXXVIII.&mdash;THE FLOWER.</h2>

<p>Why comes the flower upon the plant? That fruit
may come. And why the fruit? That it may hold, protect,
and cherish the seed. And why the seed? That
the plant may have offspring&mdash;that other plants may
grow up and be as near like itself as one living thing can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
well be like another.</p>

<p>The flower is the beginning of the seed, the first step
toward reproduction, and the fruit is the flower completed.
If it does throw aside its floral ornaments,&mdash;its petals or
other adorning or useful parts of its blooming period,&mdash;it
still retains the maturing seed and ends in the ripened fruit.</p>

<p>Look inside of almost any flower and you will see
embosomed in its petals the thread-like organs called stamens
with little yellow knobs at their ends. Shake them;
if they are ripe, they will give up the fine dust or pollen,
so light that the breeze will blow it away.</p>

<p>Some flowers have few stamens, some have many, and
of the latter the apple and cherry blossoms afford examples.
Most of the different grasses have three stamens
to each of their little flowers. For example, a head of
timothy-grass has a long thick bunch of flowers, crowded
together at the top of the slender stem. Early in the
summer, about June, you may see the little stamens
peeping out all around, three of them together, and their
little golden knobs dangling in the breeze. Some plants
have only two stamens on a flower, and there is a water
plant, called the mare’s-tail, with only one stamen. A few
flowers, indeed, are wholly destitute of this organ.</p>

<p>Besides the stamens, there are also in most flowers,
other threads, stems, or knobs, somewhat like the stamens,
but generally of a different color. These pistils, as they
are called, have their place in the centre of the flower,
whilst the stamens stand around them. Unlike the
stamens, the pistils have no pollen; but it is on the latter
that the pollen must fall, in order that the plant may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
bear seed. It is in the bottom of the pistils, that the seeds
grow, but there will be no seed, unless the dust or pollen
from the stamens, falls on the pistils.</p>

<p>Most plants bear flowers that have both stamens and
pistils. Such flowers are called <i>perfect</i> flowers. But
there are also plants that have two kinds of flowers, in
some of which are stamens only, and in the others pistils
only. Again, there are plants, some of which have
flowers with stamens only, and others of which have
flowers with pistils only. The willow-trees are such plants.</p>

<p>Of the five senses, flowers address themselves most
feelingly to two. In delighting the sense of smell they
stand pre-eminent&mdash;almost alone. Does true fragrance
ever come from anything but a plant? and are not flowers
especially the generous dispensers of grateful odors? And
to the eye what wealth of beauty do they unfold!</p>

<p>We need think of no more than the lily, the pink, and
the rose. Was <i>anything</i> ever arrayed like one of these?
When we look upon them they fill the heart with joy. We
smell of them, and exclaim that their fragrance exceeds
even their beauty. Again we look upon them, and now
we aver that their beauty surpasses their perfume.</p>

<h2><a name="XC_THE_FRUIT" id="XC_THE_FRUIT"></a>XC.&mdash;THE FRUIT.</h2>

<p class="author">Gustavus Frankenstein.</p>

<p>It is not alone the delicious grape, the grateful apple,
the luscious pear, the clustered cherries, the tart currants,
the golden orange, the sweet blackberries, the refreshing
melon, the blooming peach, the purple plum, the sun-fed
strawberries, or whatever other products of the plants we
may deem good to eat, that are entitled to the name of
fruit. The very mention, the very thought of fruit,
brings to our minds an ever-welcome idea of something
not only wholesome and pleasing to the taste, but at the
same time beautiful; for all fertile flowers, on whatever
plant they may grow, merge eventually into fruit. That
fruit may not be edible; it may be bitter, it may be sour,
it may be as dry as a chip, or it may even be poisonous,&mdash;still
it is fruit. It is fruit to the plant, if not to us.</p>

<p>The seed, we may say, is the infant offspring of the
plant, by means of which, in the course of nature, it perpetuates
its kind. The flower is the first step in the formation
of the fruit. The plant opens to the sunshine a
charming expression of form and color in the budding
flower. Nursing in its bosom the growing germ, the
flower usually sheds its gay attire, throws off its petals,
its ribbons, and its tassels, and in a sober, motherly way
devotes itself to the one great task of cherishing, perfecting,
and guarding the seed.</p>

<p>In fact, the flower, which at first seemed but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span> a transport
of joy, now shorn of its bridal ornaments, has
become the substantial fruit. That fruit is the guardian
of the seed, within which sleeps the infant plant; and
according to the needs of that seed will the fruit be
fashioned. Are the seeds to be carried far and wide?&mdash;ten
to one the fruit is furnished with a plume, a sail, or a
wing, by which to be wafted through the air, or with
hooks to cling to passing animals, or with some other contrivance
to effect conveyance.</p>

<p>Or, if the seed inside be provided with a sail, the fruit
will open and let the little seed go forth and seek its fortune
by itself. Endless are the expedients by which the
seed and the fruit seek to perpetuate the kind of plant
from which they spring.</p>

<p>We may look at the well-known fruit-head of the
dandelion, which is the prettiest
little airy-like silken ball
that can be imagined. Doubtless,
it has not occurred to
everybody, what this beautiful
sphere, so common in the meadows
and by the road-sides,
really is. Previous to this
sphere, and in the place of it,
was the flower, the well-known
yellow dandelion, which belongs
to the composite family.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 132px;">
<img src="images/leaf-dandelion.jpg" width="132" height="200" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Dandelion Head.</p>
</div>

<p>The dandelion is not really
<i>one</i> flower, but a circled group
of many small flowers or florets. These are surrounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
by an outer circle of green leaflets, which bend down
when the florets have changed into fruits, allowing them
to radiate in every direction from the core in the centre.
The whole ball is made up of many small fruits, each of
which is a single seed enclosed in a thin cover, surmounted
by an elevated circled plume.</p>

<p>Blow on this lovely little sphere, and away will fly the
little tufted fruits, some one way and some another. If
there is any breeze stirring, there is no knowing how far
they will go. It is not strange, then, that dandelions
spring up almost everywhere. See what a vast number
of fruits must go sailing about, all over the country, on a
dry midsummer’s day. It is true, not half of them grow
up into plants to make more dandelions, but a great
many of them do.</p>

<p>In the same way, the beautiful asters of our woods,
with their flowers of yellow or purplish disks, and lovely
rays of white or purple, as large as roses, let their little
fruits fly away from their heads as soon as ripe and dry.</p>

<p>There are about as many different kinds of fruits as
there are of flowers. The plants of the bean family, for
instance, have fruits like the bean pods. These pods,
when ripe and dry, split open at the two edges, and then
the beans or seeds drop out. Do you know the pods of
the honey-locust trees,&mdash;large, broad, thin, and sweet?
Clover too belongs to the bean family. You can find the
tiny pods in the dry heads of clover, if you will pick
out the little withered flowers and open them.</p>

<p>Some fruits have a kind of wings. Such are the fruits
of our beautiful maple tree; and very pretty are these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
maple keys, as they are called, when they hang in clusters
from the branches, and dangle among the leaves. At
the end, where they are joined, there is in each key a
thick, hard, round swelling, in which is the seed. When
the fruit is ripe and dry it falls off, and we may often see
the pair of keys flying away together. As they are light,
they go whirling in the wind, sometimes to a great distance.
The fruit of the ash-tree looks like that of the
maple, and also hangs in bunches; but each fruit is a
single key.</p>

<p>These are but a few of the many kinds of fruits to be
found on plants, each in itself a curiosity and a beauty;
and how much we fairly owe to them is scarcely ever in
our thoughts. If we consider but wheat alone, how valuable
to us is its little fruit, the simple grain; to say
nothing of the fruits of other grasses, such as rice, rye,
oats, and the large and generous ears of Indian-corn.</p>

<p>Nor must the cotton-plant be forgotten, whose fruit does
not indeed feed, but clothes our bodies, enters into countless
uses in every household, is indispensable on every
craft that sails the sea, and inseparable from so many industries
on land and water. The fruit of the cotton-plant
is a pod, which, bursting open, reveals a mass of
white woolly fibres, enveloping and clinging to the seeds.
This is the beautiful and useful cotton.</p>

<h3>THIRD READING.</h3>

<p>And, truly, did you ever hear of such a pitiable case, in
all your lives? Here was literally the richest breakfast
that could be set before a king, and its very richness
made it absolutely good for nothing. The poorest laborer,
sitting down to his crust of bread and cup of water, was
far better off than King Midas, whose delicate food was
really worth its weight in gold.</p>

<p>And what was to be done? Already, at breakfast,
Midas was excessively hungry. Would he be less so by
dinner-time? And how ravenous would be his appetite
for supper, which must undoubtedly consist of the same
sort of indigestible dishes as those now before him!
How many days, think you, would he survive a continuance
of this rich fare?</p>

<p>These reflections so troubled wise King Midas, that he
began to doubt whether, after all, riches are the one
desirable thing in the world, or even the most desirable.
But this was only a passing thought. So fascinated was
Midas with the glitter of the yellow metal, that he would
still have refused to give up the Golden Touch for so paltry
a consideration as a breakfast. Just imagine what a price
for one meal’s victuals! It would have been the same as
paying millions and millions of money for some fried trout,
an egg, a potato, a hot cake, and a cup of coffee!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>“It would be much too dear,” thought Midas.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, so great was his hunger, and the perplexity
of his situation, that he again groaned aloud, and
very grievously too. Our pretty Marygold could endure
it no longer. She sat a moment gazing at her father, and
trying, with all the might of her little wits, to find out
what was the matter with him. Then, with a sweet and
sorrowful impulse to comfort him, she started from her
chair, and, running to Midas, threw her arms affectionately
about his knees. He bent down and kissed her. He felt
that his little daughter’s love was worth a thousand times
more than he had gained by the Golden Touch.</p>

<p>“My precious, precious Marygold!” cried he.</p>

<p>But Marygold made no answer.</p>

<p>Alas, what had he done? How fatal was the gift
which the stranger had bestowed! The moment the lips of
Midas touched Marygold’s forehead, a change had taken
place. Her sweet, rosy face, so full of affection as it had
been, assumed a glittering yellow color, with yellow tear-drops
congealing on her cheeks. Her beautiful brown
ringlets took the same tint. Her soft and tender little
form grew hard and inflexible within her father’s
encircling arms. O terrible misfortune! The victim of
his insatiable desire for wealth, little Marygold was a
human child no longer, but a golden statue!</p>

<p>Yes, there she was, with the questioning look of love,
grief, and pity, hardened into her face. It was the
prettiest and most woful sight that ever mortal saw. All
the features and tokens of Marygold were there; even the
beloved little dimple remained in her golden chin. But,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
the more perfect was the resemblance, the greater was the
father’s agony at beholding this golden image, which was
all that was left him of a daughter.</p>

<p>It had been a favorite phrase of Midas, whenever he
felt particularly fond of the child, to say that she was
worth her weight in gold. And now the phrase had
become literally true. And, now, at last, when it was too
late, he felt how infinitely a warm and tender heart, that
loved him, exceeded in value all the wealth that could be
piled up betwixt the earth and sky!</p>

<p>It would be too sad a story, if I were to tell you how
Midas, in the fulness of all his gratified desires, began to
wring his hands and bemoan himself; and how he could
neither bear to look at Marygold, nor yet to look away
from her. Except when his eyes were fixed on the image,
he could not possibly believe that she was changed to gold.
But, stealing another glance, there was the precious little
figure, with a yellow tear-drop on its yellow cheek, and a
look so piteous and tender, that it seemed as if that very
expression must needs soften the gold, and make it flesh
again. This, however, could not be. So Midas had only
to wring his hands, and to wish that he were the poorest
man in the wide world, if the loss of all his wealth might
bring back the faintest rose-color to his dear child’s face.</p>

<p>While he was in this tumult of despair, he suddenly
beheld a stranger, standing near the door. Midas bent
down his head, without speaking; for he recognized the
same figure which had appeared to him the day before in
the treasure-room, and had bestowed on him this disastrous
power of the Golden Touch. The stranger’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
countenance still wore a smile, which seemed to shed a
yellow lustre all about the room, and gleamed on little
Marygold’s image, and on the other objects that had been
transmuted by the touch of Midas.</p>

<p>“Well, friend Midas,” said the stranger, “pray, how do
you succeed with the Golden Touch?”</p>

<p>Midas shook his head.</p>

<p>“I am very miserable,” said he.</p>

<p>“Very miserable! indeed!” exclaimed the stranger,
“and how happens that? Have I not faithfully kept my
promise with you? Have you not every thing that your
heart desired?”</p>

<p>“Gold is not every thing,” answered Midas. “And I
have lost all that my heart really cared for.”</p>

<p>“Ah! So you have made a discovery, since yesterday?”
observed the stranger. “Let us see, then. Which of these
two things do you think is really worth the most,&mdash;the
gift of the Golden Touch, or one cup of clear cold water?”</p>

<p>“O blessed water!” exclaimed Midas. “It will never
moisten my parched throat again!”</p>

<p>“The Golden Touch,” continued the stranger, “or a
crust of bread?”</p>

<p>“A piece of bread,” answered Midas, “is worth all the
gold on earth!”</p>

<p>“The Golden Touch,” asked the stranger, “or your own
little Marygold, warm, soft, and loving, as she was an
hour ago?”</p>

<p>“O my child, my dear child<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>!” cried poor King
Midas, wringing his hands. “I would not have given
that one small dimple in her chin for the power of changing
this whole big earth into a solid lump of gold!”</p>

<p>“You are wiser than you were, King Midas!” said
the stranger, looking seriously at him. “Your own
heart, I perceive, has not been entirely changed from flesh
to gold. Were it so, your case would indeed be desperate.
But you appear to be still capable of understanding that
the commonest things, such as lie within everybody’s
grasp, are more valuable than the riches which so many
mortals sigh and struggle after. Tell me, now, do you
sincerely desire to rid yourself of this Golden Touch?”</p>

<p>“It is hateful to me!” replied Midas.</p>

<p>A fly settled on his nose, but immediately fell to the
floor; for it, too, had become gold. Midas shuddered.</p>

<p>“Go, then,” said the stranger, “and plunge into the
river that glides past the bottom of your garden. Take
likewise a vase of the same water, and sprinkle it over
any object that you may desire to change back again from
gold into its former substance. If you do this in earnestness
and sincerity, it may possibly repair the mischief
which your avarice has occasioned.”</p>

<p>King Midas bowed low; and when he lifted his head,
the lustrous stranger had vanished.</p>

<p>You will easily believe that Midas lost no time in
snatching up a great earthen pitcher (but, alas me! it was
no longer earthen after he touched it), and in hastening
to the river-side. As he ran along, and forced his way
through the shrubbery, it was positively marvellous to see
how the foliage turned yellow behind him, as if the
autumn had been there, and nowhere else. On reaching
the river’s brink, he plunged headlong in, without waiting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
so much as to pull off his shoes.</p>

<p>“Poof! poof! poof!” gasped King Midas, as his head
emerged out of the water. “Well; this is really a
refreshing bath, and I think it must have quite washed
away the Golden Touch. And now for filling my pitcher!”</p>

<p>As he dipped the pitcher into the water, it gladdened
his very heart to see it change from gold into the same
good, honest, earthen vessel which it had been before he
touched it. He was conscious, also, of a change within
himself. A cold, hard, and heavy weight seemed to have
gone out of his bosom. No doubt his heart had been
gradually losing its human substance, and been changing
into insensible metal, but had now been softened back
again into flesh. Perceiving a violet, that grew on the
bank of the river, Midas touched it with his finger, and
was overjoyed to find that the delicate flower retained its
purple hue, instead of undergoing a yellow blight. The
curse of the Golden Touch had, therefore, really been
removed from him.</p>

<p>King Midas hastened back to the palace; and, I
suppose, the servants knew not what to make of it when
they saw their royal master so carefully bringing home
an earthen pitcher of water. But that water, which was
to undo all the mischief that his folly had wrought, was
more precious to Midas than an ocean of molten gold
could have been. The first thing he did, as you need
hardly be told, was to sprinkle it by handfuls over the
golden figure of little Marygold.</p>

<p>No sooner did it fall on her than you would have
laughed to see how the rosy color came back to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
dear child’s cheek!&mdash;and how astonished she was to find
herself dripping wet, and her father still throwing more
water over her!</p>

<p>“Pray do not, dear father!” cried she. “See how you
have wet my nice frock, which I put on only this
morning!”</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/p270.jpg" width="300" height="250" alt="Midas revives Marygold by sprinkling water over her" />
</div>

<p>For Marygold did not know that she had been a little
golden statue; nor could she remember any thing that had
happened since the moment when she ran with outstretched
arms to comfort poor King Midas.</p>

<p>Her father did not think it necessary to tell his
beloved child how very foolish he had been, but contented
himself with showing how much wiser he had now grown.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
For this purpose, he led little Marygold into the garden,
where he sprinkled all the remainder of the water over
the rose-bushes, and with such good effect that above five
thousand roses recovered their beautiful bloom. There
were two circumstances, however, which, as long as he
lived, used to remind King Midas of the Golden Touch.
One was, that the sands of the river in which he had
bathed, sparkled like gold; the other, that little
Marygold’s hair had now a golden tinge, which he had
never observed in it before she had been changed by the
effect of his kiss. This change of hue was really an
improvement, and made Marygold’s hair richer than in
her babyhood.</p>

<p>When King Midas had grown quite an old man, and used
to take Marygold’s children on his knee, he was fond of
telling them this marvellous story, pretty much as I have
told it to you. And then would he stroke their glossy
ringlets, and tell them that their hair, likewise, had a rich
shade of gold, which they had inherited from their mother.</p>

<p>“And, to tell you the truth, my precious little folks,”
said King Midas, “ever since that morning, I have hated
the very sight of all other gold, save this!”</p>

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the

1.E.9.

     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
